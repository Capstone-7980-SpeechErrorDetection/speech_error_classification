29.246,49.986, hello and welcome aboard the battleship pretension i'm tyler smith i'm david backs and thank you for listening david yeah how you doing film loose uh... yeah i'd say that's about right we loosened up that's what we do p behind the curtain to talk about it before we show we say we're gonna record it at eight there's no way to say in a great fifteen we end up
50.666,53.988, Talking about movies and all the other shit that's going on in our lives.
54.028,58.65,"We're both on diets right now, which is weird And now here it is nine."
58.71,68.294,"Oh seven and we're finally hitting record, but that's How we get into the groove exactly to bring you people the fantastic show you listen to it, right?"
68.394,77.058,"I mean people email and they're like Tyler David How do you have such great chemistry and we say it's a mystery, you know, it's not a mystery anymore That's how it goes"
77.478,83.702," Yeah, because we commit ourselves to at least forty-five minutes of chemistry rekindling before we record every week."
83.962,84.723,"Right, absolutely."
85.483,87.165,"So, I mentioned we're both on diets."
87.685,92.688,"Well, special thanks real quick to Bill and Mike for being on the show last week."
93.189,94.85,It was a lot of fun.
94.91,95.47,So much fun.
95.61,98.992,"I've gone back and listened to it, and man, that thing is chaos."
99.132,103.035,"It's fun chaos, and it's more organized than the Go Bull Fadum show."
103.575,106.437,"But man, it's all over the place."
107.959,109.52, It's with episodes like that.
109.54,117.748,I Go back and listen and then I laugh as though I wasn't there and I'm not laughing at the stuff I said because we didn't talk much.
117.989,123.774,"Yeah, and and it's just delightful So thank you very much to Bill and Mike for being on the show."
123.814,125.196,It was a whole lot of fun
126.098,149.019, okay we're on diets yes i want to get this out of the way all right because i'm part of what i want to do i was telling you that me myself to what is by my standards a very strict diet for the month of january only and i want to get it out i thought about tweeting about it on a mission the podcast because the more people know about it the more pressure
150.842,152.926, I will have to stick to it.
154.229,156.234,I don't have a lot of willpower.
158.081,161.624," Yeah, for the last few days, I kind of wanted to downplay it."
162.804,170.91,"Because on this will tell you my thought process is, it's just like, well, whenever I inevitably fail, which is going to be way sooner than anybody thinks."
172.09,176.353,"You know, that's fewer people have to say, yeah, I failed and I quit because I'm a quitter."
176.513,177.034,And that's me.
178.014,183.858,"And so I decided like, I'm not gonna I don't think I'm gonna tell anybody, but it's just like, you know what, whatever, let's, let's just do it."
184.279,187.601,"And the last few days, I've done much better than I thought I would."
188.281,199.528," So I have found that I am Okay, I'm not and have never been like obese But you know in recent years, I guess my metabolism has slowed."
199.568,210.454,I have gotten overweight at this point I'm about I weigh about fifteen pounds more than I would like to Mm-hmm Fifteen pounds more than the top of the acceptable threshold.
210.634,216.798,"I'd like to wave and I'd like to losing more than fifteen pounds, but that's where I would be at least mostly happy"
217.878,229.486, But what I've found from being on this diet is that I think that I think about food the way that a chronic overeater does.
230.646,242.694,"Even though I don't eat all the time, I realize just how much of my mind and my planning for the day is taken up with the food that I'm going to eat."
243.234,245.957," Well, I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with it."
245.977,256.488,"Are you talking about like if you're planning a certain meal for dinner and it's a few hours before, I don't think there's anything wrong with like looking forward to that meal and being like, I can't wait to have that meal."
256.508,257.249,That'll be a lot of fun.
257.748,270.811," I guess, but I mean, I like, I tend to know, like I'll be at home the night, like getting ready to go to bed and I'll be hungry and I'll have breakfast to bring to work with me, but I'll already know where I'm going to go for lunch the next day."
272.471,274.031,That is planning in advance.
274.131,278.812,"And you know what, maybe it's, for me, my whole life is like that because I only ever have a few things."
279.312,281.353,"So it's like, well, it's probably going to be one of these three."
281.373,281.993,I like all of them.
282.153,283.233,So this works out well for me.
283.853,285.033, I think about food way too much.
285.073,296.176,But the other thing about this diet is that I have not had anything to drink since I woke up New Year's Day.
296.736,297.436,"Alcoholic, you mean."
298.056,299.697,"Yeah, I've had water and tea."
299.777,300.157,Okay.
300.237,300.597,That's it.
302.517,305.278,And I am not sure
307.501,310.703, that I have been sober this long since I turned twenty one.
311.143,311.444,Wow.
312.124,322.05,It's been five days and like I don't know that I've because usually if I'm sick I won't drink but I don't tend to get sick for more than three or four days.
322.371,322.551,Right.
322.771,322.911,So
324.628,328.67," I think five days might be, this might be the longest I've been sober since I turned twenty-one."
328.871,331.032,"Do you feel any different, like physically?"
331.092,332.513,Do you notice a difference?
332.553,333.774,"Again, I'm going to get all this out here."
335.355,339.837,"You know, I don't like drink to excess every day."
339.857,344.48,I actually very rarely drink to the point of drunkenness anymore.
344.5,349.403,"That happens once every few months maybe, some sort of special occasion, a party or something."
349.963,352.225,But I do tend to have drinks every day.
352.825,361.887, And a big part because I work my day job and then I usually either come here to record or I go straight out or I go to a press screening.
361.947,364.348,I don't want to get into what that is.
365.588,367.088,But sometimes I have these screening things.
369.049,370.929,And I also take public transportation.
371.77,375.11,So I often don't get home.
375.53,378.811,"I leave work, I leave the house at eight in the morning."
378.831,381.512,I often don't get home until maybe ten thirty or eleven.
383.193,402.744," I want to unwind and so I tend to take the edge off I tend to turn on the my Another peek inside the curtain I turn on the NHL network to watch the highlights from the day's games and I pour myself a rum and coke and Then sometimes I pour myself another rum and coke after that and Natalie's in the kitchen crying No, she goes to sleep because she gets up and goes to the gym early."
402.884,403.824,"Oh, she's much more."
404.245,411.429,She's much healthier than I am And so I have found the past couple nights
413.393,418.531, Going to sleep stone cold sober is sadly a weird thing for me.
419.966,447.001, criminally and you are really putting a lot out there but not like again i'm not like drinking to the point of right it's just i don't think it's that abnormal to have a drink at the end of the day occasionally two drinks at the end of the day no um but uh i've realized that i'm a little bit like lubricated when i go to sleep most of the time and like i've it's taken me a bit longer to fall asleep the past few nights
447.532,447.932, All right.
447.952,450.955,So what are the effects of your diet?
451.355,453.877,Well... Are you cranky?
454.218,455.639,Yeah.
455.739,456.519,Very much so.
458.741,461.243,"I've cut out soda, and I wasn't really drinking a lot of soda."
461.263,468.81,"I was drinking one or two cans per day, usually one these days, in eliminating it."
468.93,474.614,"But I would go out to coffee with friends on a pretty regular basis, and I would drink a lot of coffee."
476.956,495.032," I thought I was doing pretty good with caffeine and then I didn't have it for two days and I had pounding headaches and I was irritable, very irritable at all my friends and at myself and me being who I am and I would do a thing where"
496.696,498.657," Okay, I'll just be honest."
499.037,506.24,"The phrase fat fuck has been thrown around in my head, which is like, how did you let it get to this point, you fat fuck?"
506.461,508.381,That's what it was for the first few days.
509.042,512.883,And then I kind of have come out of that a little bit.
512.924,515.024,"The headaches persist, but I take care of those."
516.085,518.106,But now I'm getting to- Those won't last the whole month.
518.586,519.446,"No, I don't think so."
520.087,524.629,And so I'm getting to a point where it's becoming tolerable.
525.109,538.552," And it's interesting because I'm doing sort of the Atkins thing, so I'm eating a lot more meat, and that means for breakfast, rather than have the bowl of cereal that I normally would have, or let's be honest, two or three, Apple Jacks are good, I don't know what to tell you."
539.153,544.674,"And so, rather than do that, I now make bacon and eggs, both of which are perfectly fine to have."
545.354,548.775,"And even bacon, which is greasy as can be, but"
549.502,550.342, What do you put in the pan?
551.883,553.484,"I put, for bacon, nothing."
553.864,555.024,What about for the eggs?
555.925,556.125,Butter.
556.745,565.489,"This is how strict my diet is, that I have switched to either olive oil or using a non-stick pan."
566.589,567.89," Well, you're a better person than I am."
567.93,575.833,"So when I do cook various meats, like pork chops and chicken and that sort of thing, I do use olive oil for that, yes."
576.294,581.316,"But anyway, so here's what I've rediscovered."
582.436,583.537,Bacon is awesome.
584.577,586.458,I forgot how wonderful it is.
587.098,589.519,I never forgot.
590.94,591.6,It's one of those things.
593.106,597.247," I would be on a, when I was younger, like I would go on like a, like a food kick for a while."
597.667,600.608,"And I remember for a long time, it was just like, man, bacon is great."
600.668,604.689,"And then just for some reason, I guess I just didn't have it very often and then we didn't buy it."
605.229,611.251,"And, uh, and then I had it again for this and I was like, oh, why did, why did I stop having this?"
611.891,612.171,"This is the,"
612.811,642.203, is the best thing and i was uh... so yes and now every morning i very much i still not a huge fan of eggs but i am uh... because you can just have bacon in the morning that's kind of insane and uh... and so although you know when we live together in college there are many mornings that i had just bacon or just bacon on toast yes and i just have a and that's the thing is my go-to peanut butter toast that's out now i have peanut butter on celery which is awful because celery is awful
642.523,643.644, But you can still have peanut butter.
643.844,644.265,"Yeah, you can."
644.285,644.545,Yeah.
644.745,644.965,Okay.
644.985,645.806,You can't have a lot of it.
646.446,647.107,But you can have some.
647.487,647.708,All right.
647.968,654.013,"But But yeah, so it's, you know, I'm sure people this has nothing to do with film, this whole thing."
654.113,659.798,But people seem to like that look back episode and how much we talked about ourselves.
659.858,660.639,So you're welcome.
660.979,661.579, I guess.
661.78,663.781,So let me get into another thing.
663.801,667.744,It'll be a little bit of a thing and then we'll get it into our main topic.
669.965,674.448,Monday I'm home from work as are I understand a lot of people are but my girlfriend wasn't.
675.189,676.63,So I'm home hungry.
680.092,684.795,And you know I got very little to do.
684.815,686.756,I did clean up the apartment.
686.776,687.557,I'm a good boyfriend.
688.457,690.719,Good roommate as you know.
693.962,694.562," Yeah, I guess so."
695.523,696.304,I cleaned up.
696.324,699.447,"You know what, I did not register that you had said roommate."
700.388,701.409,I only heard boyfriend.
701.649,706.233,"And then you said, as you know, I was like, I don't really pay much attention to your relationships, but okay, sure."
706.253,708.115,"No, but I cleaned up."
708.556,709.677,"Yes, you were very good."
709.737,712.74,"You cleaned up more often than I did and much more thoroughly, I think."
712.8,713.04,"Oh, good."
713.36,714.861," Okay, so I did a little of that."
715.321,717.861,"But you know, that takes up not very much time."
718.322,720.122,I don't have a mansion.
724.744,731.126,"So I watched a movie, a blu ray that I had from Netflix, which we'll get into later."
731.646,735.087,And then I still had a couple hours to kill.
737.026,758.371, noticed online that at the three dollar theater that's uh very close to your place and not too far from my place we live near each other um brett ratner's tower heist was about to start yeah so i disgrace to brett ratner's tower heist yes yeah um yeah uh vile homophobe brett ratner
759.552,763.474," I've started... By the way, vile, that's not new."
764.134,767.436,"Like, the homophobe thing is new, although we all kind of knew it anyway."
768.096,769.677,"The vile thing, that's been around a while."
770.157,783.083,"My new thing, this is off-topic, and I don't know how you'll feel about this, but because Santorum, Rick Santorum, has been doing well in the polls, I've taken to referring to him in everyday speech as vile homophobe Rick Santorum."
783.203,784.024,That's where that came from.
784.264,788.666,Because people need to remember that he is a vile homophobe.
789.588,815.464, well it's uh... there's plenty of i have no i have no supporter of rick santorum don't get me wrong like there are some people that i do like and some uh... some people in the race i do like and some that i don't and and he he had this big surge uh... and a lot of people like oh he's like he's like mike huckabee from a few years ago who won the iowa caucus and that's very exciting and part of me is like mike huckabee you may not like him and that's that's fine
816.645,826.58, he he tried to back away from like not necessarily his beliefs he wasn't ashamed of them but it's like vote for me because i was the a governor of arkansas not because i was a pastor
827.606,849.477, whereas santorum just he does a lot of things i don't like about republicans and about and about fellow christians like he just he i don't think he does it purely for political motive but it'd be like that's what it's all about for him and it's just like i hate to say it but not many people are that like economy is the big thing right now and you're not speaking to any of that
850.217,858.701, And I think it really speaks to how much Republicans don't care for Mitt Romney that they are entertaining every single person except him.
860.341,863.623,I've heard the term presumptive nominee tossed around about Mitt Romney.
863.843,864.043,Yeah.
864.323,875.208,And I think I had this theory that it's liberals who are presuming he's the nominee because he's the nominee that liberals would be most likely to vote for if that's the only option they had.
875.888,902.755, uh... probably i mean they do like ron paul has certain liberal uh... appeal as does john huntsman john huntsman's not really an entity in the government will close the fact that he's a captain be part of it damn right okay because that's the thing he's somebody he's not unlike mit romney by the way and far as far as like his demeanor and i don't mean just because they're both mormon but they just they kind of have a uh... that similar this kind of uptight demeanor and yet picturing him sitting
903.955,911.34," I have to assume bolt upright in his chair, listening to Captain Beefheart, it does not compute."
912.021,913.782,"Okay, hold on, what was I going to say?"
914.042,915.463,Presumptive nominee.
915.983,919.105,"Why, what is it that Republicans don't like a bit about Mitt Romney?"
919.225,923.969,"Is it the Mormon thing, because so many Republicans are Christian, or is it like the healthcare thing?"
923.989,925.069,"It's the healthcare thing, I think."
925.85,926.79,That makes sense.
926.81,933.235,"People say that he was more moderate, and there's not, I don't think people hate that term, but"
933.735,953.564, in the republican party it's like well if you're anywhere even close to obama well then and he's closer to obama than these guys are so we don't like that but it's like well he also is that's the reason he is viewed as much more electable than the others because he actually does have a larger general he's gonna have to
954.604,981.602, exactly have to be more moderate exactly it's a it's a very strange thing but i think i was going to say is that i'm glad you didn't that you're okay with me really disliking rick santorum because okay obviously my views tend to line up a little more with the left i have some uh... more conservative uh... views on some topics but jenny i'm with the left so there are a lot of public and uh... you know candidates that i'm crazy about in any sense
983.183,986.324," They're the ones that I disagree with very, very strongly."
987.265,993.947,"And then there's Rick Santorum, whom I just outwardly dislike because he is a vile homophobe."
995.628,1001.45,"And he's got, he has such a, I do not consider Andy Samberg on SNL to be a good impressionist."
1002.47,1006.552,"He's got Rick Santorum down, just like vaguely angry."
1008.214,1024.527, uncomfortable in his own skin uh and just like just like shifting around like oh i just can't believe i have to be here with people that seems to be his general thing and i just uh i mean here's the thing like he's he i've i've like i said i've watched like debates and i've watched interviews and stuff and and
1026.549,1051.044," He's he seems to be like a good man in some respects and when he talks about like his family like I Really feel like he's not exploiting that for his own political gain, and it's just like oh, it's that's interesting I'd like more of this like a gentler person but but then like when it comes time to like all right time to campaign and I'm going to represent just the just the"
1051.864,1053.005, Not necessarily the worst.
1053.065,1055.267,"There have been worse, I have to assume."
1056.868,1061.212,Because I remember not liking Giuliani in spite of the fact that he was moderate.
1061.252,1064.475,It's just his answer to everything three years ago was nine-eleven.
1064.495,1065.956,That's all he ever said.
1065.976,1068.998,But don't worry.
1069.319,1072.561,"Santorum's going to go, like everyone else, he's going to go down."
1072.901,1078.806,"Especially once people are like, oh, look at all the interviews he's giving talking about how much he defends the idea of earmarks."
1078.826,1080.047,That's not going to go over well.
1082.039,1083.06, So do you think it'll be Mitt Romney?
1083.08,1084.961,"You think the party will come to its senses and say, this is the guy who could beat?"
1084.981,1085.041,Yes.
1085.061,1085.481,I think it'll be that.
1085.501,1087.382,"And I think it's just, it's like, it's one of those things, like he has stayed at the solid."
1087.402,1087.803,"I'm sorry, everybody."
1087.823,1088.723,I have been following this quite a bit.
1088.743,1103.953,He stayed at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at the solid at
1104.417,1107.579," Bachman, Perry, Cain, Gingrich, Santorum."
1107.599,1108.16,He's the tortoise.
1108.86,1109.481,He's the tortoise.
1109.781,1113.904,"He's also, as they said on... SNL does a really good job with Romney."
1114.244,1115.205,He is Forrest Gump.
1117.166,1118.387,And the country is Jenny.
1118.787,1122.85,"They'll try everyone else, they'll sow their wild oats, and he'll just be there waiting."
1124.122,1148.137, good old boring Forrest Gump all right so I saw Tower Heist okay and upon leaving the theater I jumped on Twitter I'm in like a sort of somewhat tweet heavy phase right now I go through periods but I was like I want to tweet and what I tweeted I gotta do something instead of drink right was
1149.458,1160.001, Was my sort of surprise that I didn't hear more people Defending tower heist because it is it is a pretty decent movie.
1160.341,1170.763,Mm-hmm It's got some problems most of them in terms of just sheer physics I'm I'm pretty sure I don't think this is a major spoiler.
1171.243,1171.964,I'm pretty sure that
1173.964,1178.805," a single elevator can't hold eight people, a dog, and a motherfucking Ferrari."
1179.865,1182.766,I don't think that- Is it a freight elevator?
1183.166,1183.306,No.
1183.486,1183.806,It might.
1184.166,1185.286,It's a regular elevator.
1186.367,1189.867,"I don't think that- even if the Ferrari's on top of the elevator, I don't think that can happen."
1190.387,1197.709,I don't think you can hang a Ferrari out the window of a building by hooking it at one point.
1197.769,1200.389,I feel like you're just gonna hit- you're gonna keep that part.
1200.769,1203.13,The rest of the car is gonna break off and fall to the ground.
1203.982,1231.83, uh... i there's lots of things i don't think browser put together well that's all i can most of them having to do with the ferrari thing but there are some other uh... things that that don't work and really bothered me uh... like matthew bradyk risks his life to get the ferrari in the lower window but then they don't know what to do with it it until casey affleck comes along it doesn't make any sense you didn't think the plan out more than just get the ferrari down a few floors
1232.93,1237.175, and Matthew Broderick almost dies for a plan that you didn't have.
1238.236,1241.559,"You had point A to B, but you didn't have the rest of the plan."
1241.579,1242.9,It really bothered me.
1243.181,1244.502,"Anyway, this is not the point."
1244.762,1251.109,The point is that it is generally a fun movie that largely steers clear of the
1253.897,1273.927, cringing uh... stereotype type humor that i was expecting from brett ratner mhm uh... and frankly from letter period and ready murphy uh... i mean that there's a little bit of it but it comes back to character and uh... there are ways that are defensible by character uh... and so i was i was okay with that uh... i liked that you know uh...
1276.949,1283.016," I liked that it's very sort of timely, like the nine-nine-percent-against-one-percent theme, you know?"
1284.558,1290.124,"And that it was consistent in that theme, not just introducing it and then moving on to the heist thing."
1290.144,1291.125,It really was about that.
1293.368,1297.01," And by the way, if you're one of those critics, like, I love J.R."
1297.05,1298.331,Jones for Chicago Reader.
1299.312,1299.852,I really do.
1299.932,1302.073,He's actually one of my favorite and most read critics.
1302.454,1310.999,"But when he says, like, if you want to see a bunch of rich people whine about your problems, rich actors is what he means."
1311.279,1313.821,"It's like, come on, we're not in high school anymore."
1313.941,1315.622,"Like, have some pragmatism."
1315.862,1316.743,The actors are rich.
1317.443,1317.904, God forbid.
1317.944,1318.564,That's what you need.
1318.985,1320.907,That's just a baseline.
1321.448,1321.948,Get over it.
1322.309,1322.809,They're rich.
1323.39,1326.373,Rich people's opinions are worthwhile as well.
1327.174,1329.297,"Anyway, that's my rant at J.R."
1329.317,1331.059,Jones who will never hear this or care.
1331.92,1332.5,You don't know that.
1334.042,1335.142, He's a big fan of Bill Dwyer.
1339.223,1339.784,I liked that.
1339.944,1345.985,I liked that the cast was a lot of different colors.
1347.046,1359.509,"A few too many of the leads are white, which is disappointing given that the original idea for the film was that it would be, it was pitched as a quote-unquote Black Oceans Eleven and then they kept"
1360.329,1381.116, characters to white but there are obviously michael pena is in a gallery that's it a very eddie murphy uh... and there's a number of other uh... black and hispanic and asian characters in the movie which is realistic uh... in terms of a portrait of the staff at a hotel right uh... or or or uh... an apartment building would look like
1382.336,1400.375, um and it was uh it was fun it could it could have used a few more jokes but it was it was fun um how is i know that this might go against the uh sort of the multi-racial thing for me to ask about alan alda the whitest of the of the cast members to be
1400.755,1421.965, right he's the one character right you can turn all the other characters uh... black he's the character needs to exactly but i just feel like my concern is with him because i'm a jerk no he's great and that's that to me this is a a side note with heist movies like that you need to really establish not merely the pure evil
1422.905,1430.369," of not pure evil, but you know what I mean, like the powerful antagonism of the antagonist."
1431.809,1436.712,But you need to make him like able and capable and intelligent.
1436.932,1445.556,"And it's one of the reasons why I think the Soderbergh Ocean's Eleven works is because Andy Garcia, it's a great performance and he's written very well."
1445.596,1451.479,It's like this guy is smart and capable and it probably would take eleven
1452.219,1477.899, professional con artists and thieves to rip this guy off and so that's why when i saw like this huge cast and there's alan alda who is a wonderful actor but i had said he is getting a bit older and maybe he and it might concerns that he might appear somewhat frail no okay i mean the movie starts with him swimming laps in his pool okay that's what it's like i don't know that he is not okay that's good
1479.6,1484.585," Anyway, all that aside, I had a very fun time watching Tower Heist."
1486.147,1496.658,"And so I tweeted, surprised that I didn't hear more people defending it because there was so much negativity around it when it came out, a lot of it having to do with Brett Ratner and his vile homophobia."
1499.481,1522.894, that I guess the in retrospect as you pointed out to me the reviews weren't awful I think they just got kind of drowned out and so I was surprised that I hadn't heard more about that and maybe I didn't know I didn't make that all that clear in my first tweet I just said how hey how come no one told me that tower heist was good mm-hmm
1524.855,1534.689," Just a one-off tweet turned into an hours long thing of people not being able to, I guess, swallow the idea that I liked Tower Heist."
1535.635,1538.016," Yeah, I mean, you run across that from time to time."
1538.097,1547.882,Just the fact that you are unwilling to just condemn something roundly means that you love it completely.
1548.102,1551.404,"And it's just like, come on, Twitter, you don't have to be this black and white."
1551.444,1555.887,"I recognize that in a hundred forty characters, there's not gonna be a lot of nuance, but come on."
1557.068,1559.069,"But yeah, you do run across that from time to time."
1559.289,1560.73,So I'm sorry that you had to go through that.
1561.249,1569.628, I just wanted to get it out there and I wanted the people who got mad at me on Twitter where I have twelve hundred followers
1570.919,1599.106, to know that have to do with the nothing that does okay to know that now because they got mad at me being i'm praising tower heist on my podcast which has way more than twelve hundred uh... people uh... listening yeah i think that's about right above it more and i don't know what what you know uh... a significant percentage more significantly more than twelve hundred people now are hearing my pro tower heist opinion because you didn't like it so take that twitter people
1601.127,1610.651, and you call David a contrarian anyway but this brings me the real thing I was thinking about that day
1613.877,1615.558, I mentioned the Tower Heist could have had more laughs.
1616.398,1628.243,"Another movie I watched that day that I liked a lot more, that I had mentioned earlier, I watched a Blu-ray at home, that also maybe could have had a few more laughs was Attack the Block."
1629.744,1635.087,"And so I started thinking, well, neither of these is..."
1636.207,1653.89, a straightforward comedy why am i expecting more laughs yeah so i started thinking about the idea in general of genre hybrid movies um and i mean let's get into it shall we i want to talk about
1655.712,1669.785, the different i want to start off by talking about the difference between movies that clearly someone said like hey let's do a mix of this genre right in this genre um and you know
1671.086,1682.696, It'll be it's very sort of knowing in that way and then things that are just regular movies that get shoehorned into like well That's an action comedy or that's a that's a horror Western or whatever.
1682.996,1699.069,"Yeah, I don't know if I have any horror Westerns on here on my list, but Do you have any any thoughts on that because I guess what I'm saying is that neither of those films attack the block nor tower heist and"
1702.009,1706.331, feels like a self-conscious hybrid.
1706.972,1708.332,Feels like I'm bringing that to it.
1708.432,1719.478,"Like, well, Brett Radner has made things that are nominally comedies in the past, and it's got Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, both of whom are very, very funny, or have been very funny."
1720.058,1722.499,"Michael Pena, who is always awesome."
1722.579,1723.84,Casey Affleck is funny.
1723.86,1725.661,It's got funny people in it.
1727.021,1729.723,I guess I'm just expecting a comedy.
1731.524,1745.235," And that's not really fair because that's not... Yeah, it is kind of... When you told me about this topic, and I was thinking about it, I just found myself getting frustrated because we've talked before about"
1748.541,1750.702, I don't think I would put this on the audience.
1751.382,1752.663,I could put it on studios.
1752.723,1757.145,I could put it on exhibitors and distributors.
1758.065,1760.666,I would couple in video stores with that.
1762.587,1763.907,And just this need to
1766.488,1767.409, simplify things.
1768.109,1772.832,"I mean, we both worked at video stores, and there's the drama section, the comedy section."
1772.852,1775.593,There is no comedy-drama section.
1775.613,1777.534,There is no drama-horror section.
1778.475,1779.955,It goes in one or the other.
1779.975,1785.298,"And I remember I would frequently, as I was putting movies back on the shelf, be like, what is this doing here?"
1785.398,1787.399,"And then part of me is like, well, where else would I put it?"
1787.439,1788.84,It doesn't go into any of these easily.
1790.041,1795.244,And so I was often surprised to see how much Woody Allen was in the drama section.
1796.625,1802.511," And how much, like, Wes Anderson was just straight up in the comedy section."
1803.692,1812.061,"And how many, like, suspense films that were just, there's no question, they were just suspense films, were in the horror section."
1812.201,1812.661,It's just...
1813.883,1831.105, like seven or something being in horror you know what there's there's a grizzly there's a grizzly quality to seven that I say like okay sure I mean like the Boston Strangler with Tony Curtis like right aside for like that's like putting Zodiac in in horror in horror yeah it's
1832.126,1833.567, I guess there's horrific things to it.
1833.607,1834.948,"I mean, if you want to look at it that way."
1834.968,1838.91,"There's some very horrific things in Zodiac, or in The Boston Strangle, which I haven't seen."
1839.05,1842.692,"And there's some grisly imagery in Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, but I'm not sure."
1842.952,1846.534,"And it is largely considered to be horror, but that seems like more of a drama to me."
1847.895,1852.577,"And so I just started thinking in those terms, and I went through various"
1854.398,1868.17," I'm not sure if I'd say these are the most common genre hybrids, but the first ones to pop into my mind, but that like how often people are just, and I'm probably like this as well."
1869.813,1890.622, they will only think of this a certain way when it is clearly supposed to be a mix of the two uh... one that i actually didn't write down but i'm just thinking of now like i mean is is scott pilgrim an action movie or a comedy uh... yeah that's that's a good point and that's uh... mean and writes one of those is very good at it uh...
1892.183,1903.109," But Scott Pilgrim is different than Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, because those are, I think, the thing I'm talking about where they're self-conscious about their mixing."
1903.309,1906.971,"Whereas, yeah, Scott Pilgrim is both."
1907.452,1913.135,And I think that's... I don't feel the need to call it an action comedy.
1913.775,1918.838," I can call it a comedy if I'm talking about it in comedic terms, and I can call it an action film if I'm talking about it in action terms."
1918.959,1929.105,"I recently said that it, on Twitter, I've been, like I said, been tweet-happy, that it was one of the top five action movies of the last five years."
1929.706,1933.968,"So I was doing this thing, I was thinking, oh, I'm really excited to see Mission Impossible IV, which I still haven't done."
1934.929,1938.65," Because I love Mission Impossible III, and then I was like, oh, Apocalypto came out that year too."
1938.83,1940.25,That was a good year for action movies.
1940.791,1941.811,That was five years ago.
1942.351,1947.752,I wonder what the five best action movies to have come out since Mission Impossible III and Apocalypto are.
1947.972,1949.773,And so I tweeted them and I don't even remember what they were.
1949.953,1950.153,Right.
1950.693,1954.294,"Did that, did that, did including Scott Pilgrim, did that get any sort of reaction?"
1954.679,1979.582, now i think that well that's because the distraction was that i included uh... infant was shooter uh... on my last night i still defend to this day i know i think it is a is a wonderful film uh... but most yet most of the responses were like shooter really but you'd be surprised well maybe maybe you wouldn't but i think people be surprised how often uh... critics
1981.123,1995.377, I think when you're dealing with comedy especially how often critics say that like too much action or too much visual effects Ruins the laughter because laughter needs to feel spontaneous and few things feel more choreographed than an action sequence even
1996.938,2024.265, even if it's even if it doesn't feel choreographed the knowledge that it is makes the laughter not work and this goes back i remember while ghostbusters was generally loved there were there were a handful of people who said like i don't know i don't know special effects and comedy go well together um and i'm sure and i think i i seem to recall reading some reviews about scott pilgrim is just like i mean the action was so well done that i i was
2025.885,2028.826," I don't think they spoke this hyperbolically, but I'll use this."
2029.166,2033.488,"It's like I was so breathless that I had no breath left over to laugh, you know?"
2033.568,2042.371,"And it's just... But I still think that's, I mean... I think that's valid, that I think special effects in comedy is a hard thing to pull off."
2042.411,2047.492,"Not all films are Scott Pilgrim or Ghostbusters, which, I mean, Ghostbusters is..."
2050.931,2072.108, less funny toward the end uh... i i i i think uh... when the special effects become bigger it goes but is it on my list for other reasons because it starts off with what with that legitimate horror scene oh yeah uh... but let me look at movies like evolution you know uh... that's direct by and i'm and i'm and yet and that's the perfect example of
2073.209,2083.863," CG and like big, you know visual effects and comedy just not working because the comedy clearly took a backseat and like Orlando Jones and David Duchovny clearly both think they're in different types of comedies."
2083.883,2084.925,Have you seen the film?
2085.065,2085.505,"I saw it, yeah."
2085.525,2087.228,It is uncomfortable to watch.
2087.368,2087.588,Yeah.
2088.109,2088.81,It's not good.
2090.391,2096.697," Well, I do want to focus on Ghostbusters a little bit because one thing that I like about it... What?"
2097.217,2100.02,I was thinking of the part from Evolution that makes me laugh.
2100.22,2100.56,Which is what?
2100.58,2103.663,Which is the interview with the redneck guy who got his hand bitten off by an alien.
2103.683,2104.584,I don't remember that part.
2104.604,2106.285,He's just like talking in this sort of like...
2107.046,2113.529," drawl and he's like, I saw it, walked over to check on it, jumped up and he holds up his thumb, he's like, you took my hand."
2114.89,2115.61,Do you know who plays?
2115.65,2115.891,I don't.
2116.271,2117.211,I bet it's somebody of note.
2118.632,2121.373,"But, you know, it's interesting."
2122.754,2126.236,"I've been, for no particular reason, I've been, oh, no, that's not true."
2126.616,2127.657,There is a specific reason.
2128.077,2129.317,"Somebody, I don't remember who,"
2132.797,2148.846," it was, I don't remember who, but that's okay, tweeted or put on Facebook a photo, a rather sad photo of Ernie Hudson at a, one of those conventions where you, you know, where celebrities sign photos and that sort of thing."
2149.186,2150.727,That doesn't necessarily make it sad.
2151.007,2153.408,What makes it sad is that he's in his Ghostbusters outfit.
2153.908,2156.87,"And it's just like, oh God, that's unfortunate."
2158.471,2160.652,"And so I've been thinking a lot about Ghostbusters and part of me is like,"
2161.813,2162.533," It's like, you know what?"
2163.994,2165.736,"My first instinct was like, oh, that's sad."
2165.796,2167.517,"And I was like, that's Ernie Hudson."
2167.677,2168.658,He was in Oz.
2168.918,2171.32,"He was in, you know, he's doing fine."
2171.8,2173.121,He's just doing this thing as well.
2173.702,2177.665,"And so I'm like, I don't need to pity this guy."
2177.905,2178.385,He'll be fine.
2178.405,2179.386,And he's a good actor and all that.
2179.846,2182.488,"And so, but it got me thinking about Ghostbusters in general."
2183.009,2189.774,"And some of the stuff that I love about it is how much, and maybe this is why it works."
2191.229,2199.698," from a script standpoint as a comedy with major special effects, supernatural undertones, and even at the end when the laughs are not quite as big."
2202.27,2223.687, the character of peter bankman is such a such an unusual character keen pretty much never he doesn't have a single line that i'm aware of a single line that is not glib and funny and making a wisecrack now that now bill murray will sometimes give a facial expression that says i understand the circumstances
2224.827,2237.322, but he never has a line that that says okay enough joking let's get to it he even said like even when he's calling when he when he first sees the dana barrett as a going we were is possessed
2238.59,2265.018, and he calls back to you know the other ghostbusters and says like hey here's the situation the way he phrases it is like it would appear the goes is uh... putting the moves on my would be girlfriend it's just like you're concerned for her right and he is but that's the thing is the film is so committed to being a comedy that in any other circumstances when the when the characters be like all right look we're all gonna die so let's stop making jokes
2265.618,2266.9," The film's like, we're not going to do that."
2266.92,2267.861,We're going to do something else.
2268.001,2270.424,And that's why it works as a comedy.
2270.805,2275.751,"And somehow it makes the special effects, I don't know."
2277.693,2281.799,They have more power when they're not calling attention solely to themselves.
2282.895,2283.855, Does that make any sense at all?
2283.895,2288.136,"Like, if it's just, if it's like, okay, we've had the comedy, now it's time for the effects."
2288.496,2294.057,"It's like, no, the comedy is still going to be here and that makes the effect, it makes everything in the proper proportion."
2294.738,2305.3,"And that's why I think it's certainly first and foremost a comedy, but there are, speaking as somebody who was raised in the church, I still know plenty of people who like, I wasn't comfortable with, I don't necessarily,"
2305.66,2311.984," agree with these people, but they're like, I don't, I don't, I don't feel comfortable watching that, that movie, all this demonic stuff."
2312.004,2313.244,"And I was like, it's a comedy."
2313.825,2314.045,What?
2315.045,2320.989,"But that's the thing for some, for some people, like they do such a good job of evoking, like, like that first scene, it's genuinely frightening."
2322.189,2330.314,"They do such a good job with that, that I guess for some people, it's just as much a, not necessarily a horror movie, but just as much a supernatural thing as it is a comedy."
2330.594,2330.714,Yeah.
2331.94,2334.263," I spent way too much time talking about Ghostbusters, I apologize."
2334.343,2348.8,"The thing you talk about when things getting serious, it's why as much as there are a lot of things about Martin Brest's Beverly Hills Cop that I like a lot,"
2350.262,2364.863," Climactic shootout is just a bummer because there's like yeah, there's no jokes in it and Martin breast is not a director of action It's a really stodgy and boring shootout and you kind of like I"
2366.531,2380.241, uh... i guess forget that it's supposed to be a comedy and you and you lose and so for all the all the grace of the best action thing that happens in beverly hills copies the opening with the runaway truck uh... and then from there it's tell downhill action wise and so that
2382.042,2401.827," As successful and popular as Beverly Hills Cop is I don't think it is I mean successful financially I don't think it is a successful hybrid whereas Eddie Murphy does star in one of the all-time most successful action-comedy hybrids for me, which is Forty-Eight Hours, which is a movie that Seems to come up on this podcast a lot."
2402.067,2403.428,Well from you because I haven't seen it.
2403.888,2409.149,I I love it You gotta see I know I'm a fan of Nick Nolte and I feel like I would I would like that a lot.
2409.169,2409.189,I
2409.48,2429.697, it you know what we've always for five years and almost been doing this podcast and we've talked so often about lead releasing a special features like our own personal commentary tracks and for like movies that come up a lot we should still do that and i think forty hours should be on the list because it is a movie that i love uh... that's that's one that works and uh...
2432.026,2451.952, uh... i think we because it's from uh... uh... an action director and he just like uh... you know he uh... he told eddie murphy he wasn't making a comedy he just uh... let them in eddie murphy at that time was at the top of his game and i couldn't help being funny if occasionally a vile homophobe
2452.713,2467.092, um but uh so he made he made it an action movie first and i think that was um that was a good choice that that he made because that was that's where he was comfortable and so
2468.76,2483.114, it isn't one of those movies like Beverly Hills Cop who's where it's like okay this is a comedy scene this is Eddie Murphy and Bronson Pinchot and then this is an action scene with a runaway truck you know it not going back and forth it's a it's pretty much an action film throughout with jokes now the
2484.495,2511.095, before I before I let you clear something to say I also want to bring up the single greatest action comedy of all time and maybe one of the most successful genre hybrids of all time one of the funniest movies of all time for me midnight run oh yeah that one almost doesn't need to be in this conversation because it's like you know what there's no way to analyze it they just did it they made the perfect action comedy
2511.721,2520.79," Yeah, and I guess this leads into what I was going to say, which is actually more of a question that might change, I don't know, might change the direction of the conversation a little bit."
2522.131,2532.901,"You know, you mentioned that, you know, Forty-Eight Hours or Beverly Hills Cop is like first and foremost, it's this genre and then it maybe doesn't work that way, but that like"
2534.184,2539.647," In talking about a lot of these movies, it can be described, they are first and foremost this."
2539.787,2544.269,They are maybe sixty to seventy percent this genre with thirty percent this genre.
2547.808,2564.187," And so part of me feels like, well, maybe that's why they're so easily categorized this way, even if some of us who—this is going to sound really pompous, I apologize—some of us who attempt to take a more nuanced look at"
2565.308,2570.269," genre and that sort of thing, would be quick to say like, wait, that's a comedy?"
2570.309,2571.33,What about this scene?
2571.77,2572.65,Or what about that?
2572.93,2574.37,"It's like, well, you got to put it somewhere."
2575.811,2579.392,"And if it's mostly a comedy with this dramatic scene, then it's mostly a comedy."
2580.932,2587.074,And so can you think of any off the top of your head that are fifty-fifty?
2587.094,2591.015,"And I don't mean the movie Fifty-Fifty, which from what I understand is a pretty good drama comedy."
2591.317,2612.871, uh... i mean uh... i think i have a really do think midnight run works uh... as as both right and and forty hours but i think for hours is probably sixty forty but in both in both instances i'm sorry interrupts again but uh... in both instances i wonder if
2613.925,2622.408," They're comedies, they're action movies, but even before those, because those strike the proper balance, it's a buddy movie."
2623.468,2630.29,"And in focusing on character, this is a side note."
2631.47,2637.772,"So we've been talking recently a lot about formalism as something that you, how you approach film."
2638.472,2643.574,And so that immediately made me look inward and think that I'm not doing something right.
2644.174,2649.438," And, uh, but it got me, you know, I, as listeners know, I'm more of a character person."
2649.498,2652.359,I'm more of a drama and screenwriting.
2652.5,2654.501,Not that I can't appreciate formalism.
2654.601,2659.384,"I enjoyed drive, even if you didn't, which you're, you're not liking drive."
2659.684,2661.685,"I don't want to get, we'll get into this later."
2661.705,2663.066,It makes so little sense to me.
2664.127,2665.228, That's a formless dream.
2665.248,2673.812,It introduced like the term structuralism because I think that might be more actually... because the thing is I don't appreciate good form on its own.
2673.872,2679.034,If I did I would like drive more than I did and maybe I wouldn't even hate shame as much as I did.
2682.616,2684.757,But when the form... because
2686.818,2689.82, Film is a four-dimensional art.
2690.24,2692.122,It takes place over a certain amount of time.
2692.182,2695.724,So just because it's a bunch of beautiful images isn't enough for me.
2695.824,2700.888,"To me, I appreciate the form when it is used to convey the entire piece."
2700.988,2713.976,"Be it a story, or be it an emotion, or be it whatever the filmmaker is trying to get across, I like the form as... So you don't like a divorced of context, which I think many people who said form... It's like, the editing is wonderful."
2713.996,2715.978,"Yeah, but did you care about anything happening?"
2716.798,2737.066, in it yeah and that's and that's maybe why i've um okay so structuralist is what we're saying has more to do my understanding is using um the way that the piece is put together to illustrate the the the themes or motifs or or what have you okay so some blend of formalism and structuralism is maybe how i
2737.606,2744.389," Well, if that's the case, I think I'm actually, I would not say I am a structuralist, but I do kind of lean more towards that."
2746.11,2761.037,"But one thing that I've come to really embrace as I've looked inward and come out of the self-condemnation is the, this realization is like character can be such a powerful thing."
2762.638,2768.805, That we are if we have good enough characters written well enough and there's enough there and they're played.
2768.866,2775.594,"Well, that's another big thing Then they really do they are our anchor and"
2776.972,2780.795, Even and they are I use this on more than one lesson recently.
2781.135,2783.857,They are the constant in a movie full of variables.
2784.117,2797.466,"They give us something to hold on to and that is why by the way, I think the new Star Wars movies don't work and the old ones do because we have someone like Han Solo and Luke Skywalker people that are way closer to us that who we can understand."
2797.506,2801.769,"Whereas by the time, you know Qui-Gon Jinn already has got it all worked out."
2802.569,2806.292,"And so and why the Matrix works by the way, but anyway,"
2807.432,2833.518, something like midnight run it can have action sequences and then it can have goofy jokes because it is grounded anchored by strong characters that's what it's a buddy movie first and I think any I would say almost any film that attempts to explore genres you know different genres and in one film I think
2834.787,2841.413," If they work, it is probably because the characters serve as our guide."
2841.793,2844.095,They inform how we react to things.
2844.455,2851.081,"I mean, I'm looking at my list here and I'll go back to Ghostbusters as opposed to Evolution."
2852.662,2855.425,I forgot David Duchovny was in it until you just said it.
2855.845,2858.468, I remembered Orlando Jones but that was basically it.
2858.488,2859.328,"There's also, is it Julianne Moore?"
2859.389,2859.629,Is she in it?
2873.92,2895.24, like i don't i don't know any of those characters i don't have a strong sense of them i have a strong sense of peter ray egon winston lewis slimer uh... janine like that's a that's a long run uh... dana like i that's a long roster of characters with marinas that's lewis so right and so um...
2896.201,2916.25, like i know i know them by name you know as opposed to oh the actor who played this what's the name of david de keviny's character in evolution who knows who cares i bet even he couldn't tell you and that's not that's that's not a function of him that's a function of it being written poorly and so with those strong characters in ghostbusters
2917.395,2938.62," I would've gone with them really, they could've introduced like, I mean there's seeds of romance in there, there's horror, there's comedy, like they could've added in probably a few more, a few more genres and I still would've gone along with them and been on board all the way because I was with, I got such a strong sense of who these characters were."
2939.4,2944.481,"Yeah, that's why I think the thing I'm gonna come back to is that trying to make them one thing or another"
2948.168,2959.554," Or just limit them to the hybrid probably hurts your ability to, I guess, be critical of them or analyze them."
2959.734,2966.157,"We've been talking, pretty much every hybrid, I think every hybrid we've talked about so far has included comedy."
2966.398,2968.859,I think there's two reasons why that's the biggest hybrid.
2971.04,2972.101,I think because
2974.452,2983.374," A, it goes along with genres well because comedy, like action and like horror, benefits from a heightened reality."
2986.155,3000.878,"But also because I think that, this will go to something we've talked about so many times, that most of the best dramas, both film and TV, have plenty of funny stuff in them."
3001.118,3003.861," You know, Goodfellas is the example we usually go to."
3003.941,3006.843,And Sopranos is the TV version of that.
3007.084,3009.546,"Yeah, but also Deadwood, one of the funniest shows ever on TV."
3009.566,3010.807,Even The Wire is pretty funny.
3010.827,3010.907,Yeah.
3015.703,3032.758, you know uh... that those aren't part of his comedies but they're they're hilarious and it did what has big laughs in every episode now uh... and i think that's because that's that i think the best sort of storytellers especially if there's that they're trying to it
3034.059,3037.462," like, capture any sense of verisimilitude, understand that life is funny."
3038.282,3040.384,"You laugh, you probably laugh at least once a day."
3040.404,3041.124,Yeah.
3041.545,3042.345,At something.
3042.465,3043.386,"I, you know, I hope you do."
3044.547,3054.033,"And that's the thing is, like you mentioned, comedy benefits from a heightened reality, but it's interesting because comedy also helps to sell a stark realism."
3054.114,3054.994,"Yeah, exactly."
3055.034,3055.294,"You know, I"
3057.932,3067.962, I'm gonna come back to it because never mind why but um shame movie I really didn't like recently I really didn't like mm-hmm That's a big part of it.
3068.042,3081.015,"It's not it's not funny, and I think maybe you haven't seen it yet No, yeah like I think James Badge Dale bless his heart as an actor is trying to bring something some of that to it and his character is Michael Fassbender's boss and"
3081.235,3082.296, Do you know who James Badgedale is?
3082.316,3083.178,"I don't, actually."
3083.238,3085.801,I don't know what... I'm not sure what movies he's done.
3086.221,3090.086,"I know him from Rubicon, the TV show, and I guess he was also on The Pacific, which I didn't see."
3092.369,3093.37,Was he in Three Ten to Yuma?
3094.151,3094.472,I don't know.
3094.552,3094.772,Was he?
3095.407,3111.832, yes i believe so i think he was the representative of uh... the rail what the railroad okay uh... i think so i'm not a hundred percent but i think that's it uh... i did watching shame i thought i'd i'd felt bad for james badge does an actor because he's
3114.093,3140.734, have you ever been like in a conversation it's you and two other people and they are not having it conversationally and all you want to do is like break the ice and like trying to make things comfortable and like you're trying to talk to them and you're trying to get everyone to be on the same page like that's what i feel like james badger dale was doing he's like trying to make this movie bearable well and you know having not seen the film like
3142.125,3145.267, I have been in those circumstances where I'm trying to make everything a little better.
3145.547,3146.168,Here's what I do.
3146.548,3147.349,I make a joke.
3148.71,3152.192,There's a reason that you'll find comic relief in every genre.
3152.632,3158.536,"Because we look for that release, not merely in the film, in life we look for that release."
3158.556,3159.977,We went to Halloween Horror Nights.
3162.819,3186.057, uh-huh and I'm I don't consider myself to be easily frightened but I was on edge because everything's are constantly jumping out at you and it's startling that's the nature of what it is and so I found myself making jokes because it it and if I was tense I'm less tense now it relieves the tension and that's why comedy can go with
3186.918,3188.319, pretty much every genre.
3189.02,3193.623,"I mean, I guess drama could too, but I think drama isn't really a genre."
3193.663,3196.665,"It's just, I think, a natural default of any situation."
3197.146,3203.11,"But that's why if you find any hybrid, chances are comedy is in there somewhere."
3205.922,3228.585, but yeah but i do want to uh... we should move on to because we got out of town another another example of something that does it does it right and maybe does fifty-fifty or maybe it's thirty three thirty three thirty three of them uh... the princess bride no and that's it's really no it's not even thirty three thirty three thirty three is one hundred percent action film one hundred percent a comedy in one hundred percent a fantasy
3229.185,3252.781, and one of the love story yeah i want to lose four things all at the same time and it doesn't ever have to switch off but i got that blu-ray for christmas where the president no i got a great girlfriend yeah i i remember uh... i think even on the show i said that i'm not a huge fan of that but i think the more i think about it them i think i've come around on and i i i found some of the humor to be a bit glib uh...
3254.582,3255.042, But that's all right.
3255.343,3255.643,Whatever.
3255.923,3257.424,I don't care anymore.
3257.904,3261.466,"I like that as I'm getting older, I'm becoming more forgiving and not less."
3262.127,3265.769,I wish that were true of me.
3265.849,3266.589,We'll see what we can do.
3267.39,3268.911,Never mind.
3268.931,3269.631,I was going to make a joke.
3269.651,3270.092,I'm not going to.
3270.492,3277.156,"I was looking at my best of from two thousand eight, and I was like, how pedestrian?"
3278.217,3278.577,"Oh, no."
3278.677,3281.979,I'm forgiving of everyone but me.
3283.94,3291.146," But no, that doesn't mean... Here's the thing, is like, that doesn't mean that you're... I don't think that that means that my tastes are getting worse."
3291.787,3295.51,"You know, being forgiving of something doesn't mean that everything is good."
3295.91,3303.876,"But, you know, you saw some good things about Tower Heist and as such you were unwilling to write it off, as opposed to some people"
3304.577,3307.998," they would just say like Brett Ratner, I get it no thank you."
3308.018,3308.878,They either wouldn't even see it.
3308.898,3310.439,Eddie Murphy hasn't been funny in a long time.
3310.599,3324.304,They wouldn't even either wouldn't even see it or they would go in with such a preconceived idea that no matter that they would only only the bad things about the film would register and any good parts maybe were incidental if it registered at all.
3324.364,3333.287,Yeah and I say if you sit through that movie and you don't laugh at the scene where Eddie Murphy says the word bobby pin over and over again in his angry thug guy voice then
3334.268,3336.501, You're trying not to laugh because it's hilarious.
3338.266,3367.434, all right i guess uh... context is everything here uh... but uh... where on earth where we had a uh... i was just talking about why comedy is attached to everything and maybe using that as a segue into maybe some other right other hybrids i think uh... one that uh... you and i uh... i can see actually both have on our list because of something we talk about a lot uh... is alien which is uh... uh... i mean i think if you asked a hundred people in the street
3368.274,3372.04," what genre is alien, fifty of them would say sci-fi and fifty of them would say horror."
3373.843,3376.327,I think that's another one that just does it right.
3376.427,3378.671,"And if you want to complicate things further, aliens."
3379.745,3382.187," Is it horror, sci-fi, action, or drama?"
3382.207,3385.649,"Again, I think they're all drama."
3385.789,3388.471,"Basically, if you're telling a story, that's drama."
3388.831,3395.875,"That's true, but at the same time, there are plenty of horror movies where you don't care about what's going on."
3397.016,3400.258,Those aren't very good horror movies.
3400.418,3401.159,Maybe.
3401.179,3407.903,I don't really care about any of the characters in Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
3409.181,3434.849, i care about them that i care about them because they've done nothing to deserve this is that but that's basically it that's uh... so i don't consider that to be very dramatic whereas the plight of ellen ripley that is dramatic prime it the film is invested in her character and how she is changing and so that makes it a drama as well as far as she's concerned but in a i'll go i'll go to aliens i didn't write it down but i'll go to aliens but
3435.709,3462.127, you know you talk to there there are major action elements in that film but i mean that when i was a kid that movie scared the hell out of me i mean aliens coming out of the walls and i mean it's it's very frightening uh... and there's plenty of sci-fi in there and it's just uh... and to to add to the the drama element like her relationship with newt and i don't know if there's there's a lot going on in that film but uh... i'm gonna sound like a a broken record i apologize but uh...
3463.027,3471.072," But because we are so rooted in Ellen Ripley, that's why we're not questioning like, so what is what's going on here, you know?"
3471.932,3474.894,"And incidentally, we also have Bill Paxton providing some comedy."
3475.454,3491.504,"And so it's that that's no matter what we talk about, that's probably going to be what I what I arrive at is that character and character is a function of good writing, good acting and good direction and"
3492.415,3499.599," I guess this fits into writing, like having them do something that fits with the character that's been created, but that's what's going to anchor us."
3501.24,3521.37,"And I think it's not, I think, yeah, character is a part of it if that's the movie's drive, but I think it really has to do more with, for me, just if you create just an atmosphere or a world within your movie, if a movie is a place that I can invest in and believe in, that it seems consistent,"
3521.81,3549.118, right then I'll I'll buy I'll buy into it now I don't that's why alien works I mean you like unlike Star Wars which of course Star Wars is great of course but I feel Paxton and aliens but you've got Harry Dean Stanton and yeah but Kodo yeah and you've got an alien and you've got Tom Skerritt I think Tom Skerritt's great in alien as well I'm just in terms of the the comedy oh yeah yeah you know yeah but Kodo alien and Midnight Run he's a he's a he's the champ of this episode sure
3549.698,3572.136," Sure is and he was in James Bond movie where he blows up like he I don't mean he's in he's close to an explosive I mean his body blows up from the inside because he takes some sort of pill He's also in the layer the cable guy movie witless protection He's still alive yeah, he's still alive"
3573.45,3574.311, And yet he's in that.
3574.711,3576.952,And this will anger you.
3576.972,3577.492,Okay.
3577.512,3578.213,Because it angered me.
3578.513,3578.773,Okay.
3578.933,3581.554,"And I had to close caption this movie, so I had to watch it in detail."
3581.695,3581.915,Okay.
3582.295,3584.316,"I think that's the first time you ever acknowledged that, by the way."
3584.356,3586.797,I think we danced around that for a long time.
3586.937,3587.117,All right.
3587.278,3588.338,And I closed captioned that movie.
3588.358,3588.898,All right.
3588.959,3589.739,I'm not sure for what.
3589.759,3593.361,"I don't know if you saw my closed captions, if you watch movies with closed captions on."
3593.741,3620.07, uh... anyway uh... yeah but i don't know that movie i don't know is an fbi agent with infection and his character has the same name as his character in the night run and that is disgraceful well that's the director saying like my friends i'm kind of the air apparent this film is the air apparent to midnight run that's horrible that's very frustrating yeah it's disgusting you're a fan of the other three do you have time
3621.527,3622.547, I don't know if I'm a fan.
3622.627,3623.668,"You know where I'm headed, right?"
3624.528,3631.59,Richard Dreyfuss's character who wears all the same things as he does in Jaws and his character's name is Matt and he's fishing and then he dies.
3632.07,3634.531,"Part of me is just like, that is not how Matt Hooper died."
3634.631,3635.131,Thank you.
3636.631,3638.412,How do you know?
3638.492,3641.293,Because this movie doesn't exist in the same reality as Jaws.
3641.993,3642.853,So frustrating.
3645.034,3646.314,But he's a good sport for wanting to do it.
3646.761,3675.032, yeah you know at comic-con during the q and a someone asked spielberg what he thought of that scene and he managed to completely dodge the question and talk about because it was at the event of the tin tin q and a so we've been suspended and talking about three d okay not good for him didn't and no not good for him i want to hear what he thinks of that scene and there's another there's another example of uh... something that i don't think does it right like it is so that prana three d is so tongue-in-cheek
3676.599,3682.82," that I think, because it's possible to do horror comedy in a way that is both scary and both and funny."
3684.961,3685.761,It's a balancing act.
3685.781,3686.601,You got to do it right.
3686.961,3688.221,I can think of two.
3688.902,3689.462,The do it right?
3689.922,3690.122,Yeah.
3690.422,3691.802,Evil Dead and Scream.
3692.822,3693.122,"Oh, okay."
3693.283,3694.643,"Oddly enough, I didn't think of those two."
3695.003,3695.743,Behind the Mask.
3696.223,3696.683,"Oh, sure."
3696.723,3697.303,Yeah.
3697.463,3700.124,I think Shaun of the Dead at times is genuinely frightening.
3700.563,3710.398, yeah you know what i think you're right you know that we are and i think uh... zombie land has moments of of tension and i do find it funny
3712.253,3715.755," Ghostbusters in that movie, Bill Murray."
3715.836,3716.516,That's a spoiler.
3717.337,3718.617,I think people know by now.
3718.738,3720.819,"Yeah, it's been a while."
3721.439,3724.381,"Now, you never saw... What were we talking about?"
3724.401,3725.762,I felt like I had more to say about it.
3725.842,3730.165,We were talking about Piranha Three-D and I said that I didn't care for it.
3730.506,3730.806,You know what?
3731.046,3735.409,I don't know that it is... that tongue-in-cheek is the right word.
3736.41,3737.991,Because I think that's what I was expecting going in.
3739.949,3761.557, but i don't think the movie is actually like uh... super extra postmodern or like i don't think it's commenting on uh... uh... on on its on its genre so i even though i think she might be a little too highfalutin no what i mean is that i think it is
3763.149,3789.325, it's it's committed and it's it's exaggerated so i guess in some ways you could call it satire but it's not that either right satire says that there's something here to be satirized i think it's actually kind of yeah you're right i don't think tongue-in-cheek is right i think it's kind of celebrating yeah that's a good one what that is yeah yeah i think you're but that's the thing is i think it goes so far in that celebration that it forgets that like
3790.686,3815.538, to to be genuinely frightening like there's gross stuff in it like the girl getting her scalp ripped off that's a whole sub genre of horror yeah the just gory stuff that i'm not i'm not a big fan of if that's all it is and that's why piranha three d i guess i think i am glad i saw it and i think that um just the
3817.37,3842.833, the the sheer scale of the mayhem in that movie uh... i think you have to give what's his name alexander asia director i remember i think it didn't give him some credit i'll probably never watch it again because i think i'd felt like i had post-traumatic stress disorder when i left the movie i just i'd like felt sick to my stomach i didn't i did i didn't feel good about what i just watched but i'm still glad i saw it
3843.735,3852.3," But yeah, I mean the part yeah the the scalp thing but all the part leading up to it where the guy steals the boat and is trying to get away and he's just Running over people."
3852.32,3859.525,"He's just killing people left and right Thoughtlessly in like but the way in which like the way in which they die is actually surprisingly realistic, right?"
3859.565,3861.686,Like yeah them thumping against the yeah.
3861.786,3862.347,Hello the boat.
3862.387,3862.607,Yeah.
3862.647,3867.029,"Yeah, it's it's sickening It's sickening in it in that that level of realism."
3867.069,3868.971,"I feel like doesn't belong in that film like hey, what?"
3869.111,3869.271,Huh?
3870.216,3890.696, when i was in funny games all of a sudden i think that'll be at brings me to one of my work at least uh... i guess hybrid building is a hybrid but what's going to last house on the left okay is have you seen in a restaurant don't see it doesn't seem like i think i'll watch virgin spring that's fine uh... it's you know it's bit of brutal film you know it's
3892.298,3909.529, so straightforward about the like it's just awful but then there's the sheriff and his deputy character that are like just unbelievably bumbling comma it's like you're watching smoking the bandit all of a sudden yeah it is it makes the film even more unpleasant
3910.049,3925.591, instead of like cutting the tension where they're supposed to be it's like you can't have this kind of comedy after we just watch this like long like practically cinema verite style like unbroken take of someone getting raped you can't that's not gonna work
3925.891,3954.014, right comic relief is perfectly acceptable in certain kinds of horror not this kind of horror you know i mean if you had wanted to go back to uh... funny games which i recognize not straight-up or was pretty horrific you know if you had somebody slipping on a banana peel it's just like you know there's a place for it but not here but uh... welcome i want to talk about a couple other movies and get to get away from the uh... the comedy thing we're gonna we are gonna wrap up soon uh...
3955.734,3965.221," I didn't want this episode to be just a list of movies, but there's some movies that I want to talk about because they're, um, if not completely unique, they're a rare style."
3966.222,3969.805,"Um, one of them is, um, Robert Rodriguez from Dust Till Dawn."
3970.806,3971.086,Okay.
3971.226,3974.749,Which is both a crime movie and I don't know if you'd call it horror.
3976.377,3983.999," It's a crime movie and an action movie, a supernatural action movie, but I don't know that it has... I guess it does have some horror in it."
3985.08,3994.603,"I guess so, in the sense that it's very ugly, frightening-looking vampires doing grotesque, horrific things, even if I'm not scared while I'm watching it."
3994.843,3999.184,"Yeah, there's not the suspense, dread, scary thing that we talked about when we talked about suspense versus horror."
4002.165,4003.746,"But the thing is, it's essentially..."
4005.65,4013.477, action movie the whole time that has horror as well in its second half you know what i mean yeah yeah because if you want i mean
4015.064,4019.447," I think most people probably recognize this, but if you don't, watch the movie again."
4020.628,4024.49,"Literally, there are no vampires until the second half of the movie."
4025.27,4029.613,"There's no hint of vampires, it's just like, it's crazy, it comes out of nowhere."
4029.753,4038.839,"And if you've ever, I know at this point it's probably way too late, but if you've never experienced the joy of watching From Dusk Till Dawn with someone who literally has no idea what it's about,"
4039.779,4041.179, Just run out and do it.
4041.3,4041.96,You got to do it.
4042.32,4044.3,"And and that's, I don't know."
4044.641,4050.622,"I feel like with from Dusk Till Dawn, there's the possibility that could happen that someone does doesn't know what it's about."
4050.662,4058.805,"But between like, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino and stuff, I feel like almost anybody, I feel like they would think it's a vampire movie, which kind of spoils it."
4059.562,4078.303, no i don't know that i saw it back in high school and i don't see a chance where it's already seen a number of times but i was this uh... like uh... girls and i was to like we're still uh... when a movie and go to her her house uh... her parents of this awesome basement huge screens around town and i was like uh...
4079.384,4082.586," I was like, oh, have you heard of From Dusk Till Dawn?"
4082.606,4083.846,And she hadn't.
4083.886,4085.087,She wasn't a movie person.
4085.107,4085.947,This was still a high school movie.
4085.967,4088.208,"It had only been out maybe two years, maybe three."
4090.569,4092.23,And so we're watching it.
4092.67,4094.631,And then somehow it turns into a vampire.
4095.372,4099.173,And I was so in the movie that I forgot that she didn't know what was happening.
4099.273,4100.614,And so there's vampires.
4100.714,4102.675,And there's a few minutes of the vampires.
4102.735,4104.216,And I hear this girl.
4104.616,4105.676,She's sitting to my right.
4105.716,4106.177,"And she's like,"
4107.017,4109.159, What is going on?
4113.282,4114.643,Why did you bring me down?
4114.723,4117.065,I think she liked it.
4117.105,4117.925,But it's like it.
4118.406,4119.266,It is so surprising.
4119.447,4121.288,"Well, and when you think about it, like it's"
4123.174,4124.896, I think it's probably impossible for anybody.
4124.936,4126.538,"I mean, the movie is called Psycho."
4127.9,4129.021,That'll tell you something.
4129.582,4142.317,"But can you imagine going to see that movie, seeing a lead actress who is a lead, and you're following the suspense, oh, she's stolen something."
4143.198,4147.341, And now a regular person has done something illegal and is on the run.
4147.701,4149.522,Not at all unusual for Hitchcock.
4149.963,4151.364,At all.
4152.745,4157.168,"And then this thing happens, and not only is it a change of character, it's a change of genre."
4158.004,4166.331," And it's one of those things like there are times when I just like, I wish I could see certain things for the first time with a completely clean slate."
4167.492,4173.237,"I mean, the movie's called Psycho, but at the time, even at the time, did you really know what that, did people really know what that meant?"
4173.277,4181.884,"Not to say it was like a more simplistic time, but I guarantee you the movie's responsible for people throwing the word around, like that guy's a psycho."
4183.225,4183.946,"And so it's,"
4186.457,4190.881," I don't know, like that to me is so, the concept is so exhilarating."
4191.401,4193.863,And I can watch Psycho and I can still enjoy it.
4193.883,4198.247,"And it still is, you know, Martin Balsam walking up those stairs is still like pulse pounding."
4198.287,4206.393,"And even the form coming towards the showers is still, I know what happens, but it's still like, oh, it's so well constructed."
4206.914,4215.801,"But just like, what would it have been like to just experience that completely fresh?"
4216.363,4234.413, yeah i don't know it's that that to me is like such a it's a mix of genre but it's also just a change of genre yeah halfway through another one i want to talk about before we wrap up that also the ship has definitely sailed on on this one you can't there's no way you could surprise them with this because everyone knows
4235.173,4249.824," Um, and also is one that I think is so much in the public conscious that people don't really think about it, but, uh, Predator is just, it's just a Schwarzenegger action movie, a better than average one, but it's just a jungle action movie for about its first half."
4249.864,4256.989,"I mean, I think if you know, then when you go back, you see like things like the skinned bodies hanging and you know that that's, that's foreshadowing."
4257.029,4259.871,"But if you're watching it for the first time, it's just an action movie."
4260.692,4285.761, for about its first half yeah and it's and it's not he said like it's it's an arnold schwarzenegger action movie it's like commando yet but we have a commitment and command i mean john mckinnon was kinda in his group with their and very much so but as far as audiences now it's like almond carl weathers is in this it's just this you know it's a team of commandos who are going in and uh... they're gonna
4286.701,4289.343," You know, there seems to be something a little shady and political going on."
4289.623,4295.788,And the film does such a good job of setting up the espionage and the betrayal.
4296.108,4298.349,The betrayal has nothing to do with the alien at all.
4298.39,4298.83,They don't know.
4298.93,4305.154,"It's not like, yeah, we actually knew the whole time this alien was in here and we wanted to send you to collect it like an aliens or alien."
4306.455,4307.056,It wasn't that.
4307.716,4309.017,It's a total misdirect.
4310.358,4311.499,And it is one of those things.
4313.681,4314.301,I'm okay.
4314.401,4314.781,I'm dumb.
4315.041,4315.502,Here's the thing.
4316.872,4321.014, I have watched Predator in the last couple years with people that have not seen it.
4322.015,4331.639,"And I, in spite of the fact that the Predator is on the cover of my DVD, and everyone just knows it now."
4331.839,4338.102,"You hear the word Predator, I think a lot of people are going to think of the alien before they think of what the word means."
4341.704,4346.667," But nonetheless, I still don't want to give it away."
4346.808,4348.849,"It's like, they know it, Tyler, come on."
4349.729,4354.953,"But I still refuse to, much in the same way as when I... Spoilers, I guess."
4355.874,4366.541,"History of violence, when I describe it to people, and I'm trying to... I worked at a video store when it came out on DVD, and when I would describe it to people, I never said that he actually was this person."
4367.501,4370.824,"And I realized, Tyler, you're working against the title of the film."
4371.544,4371.612, you
4372.594,4373.495, They probably got it.
4373.935,4375.256,"And I was just like, oh, yeah."
4376.036,4378.298,"Oh, well, I'm going to continue with my ruse."
4378.938,4387.264,"I have, um, I've given into the idea that this year's Midnight in Paris, most people now know what happens in it."
4387.844,4389.005,But I didn't when I first saw it.
4389.025,4391.887,"And I think that that, that not knowing is a great treat."
4392.067,4393.108,"I didn't, I didn't know either."
4393.128,4393.488,Yeah.
4394.028,4398.471,"And so I still, even though I think most people know, I, I try not to talk about it just in case."
4398.611,4398.792,Yeah.
4398.932,4401.874,"Because I think it's, it's, it's worth going in not knowing."
4404.656,4410.981," And it's recent enough that I think you'll find people that don't know it, and because it's not"
4412.475,4420.763," The twist is not an unheard of thing for Woody Allen, but given the kind of movie that it starts out being, that seems like a pretty regular Woody Allen movie too."
4421.103,4421.744,"Yeah, exactly."
4421.964,4431.372,"So yeah, I think listeners, if you don't know the twist, and it's not an end of the movie twist, it's about halfway through."
4431.633,4432.794,I think it's less than halfway through.
4432.814,4434.115,I think it's... Half hour in?
4435.036,4436.357," Yeah, probably at most."
4436.377,4441.003,"I mean, it's not a very long film, so I'd probably say twenty, twenty-five minutes in is when it first happens."
4441.243,4446.069,"And I think maybe because it's not at the end of the movie twist, people have been more comfortable"
4447.819,4476.954, talking about it yeah and i guess in theory like even if you don't even if you're not looking to find out what the story is about you could even just look at the cast list and see the names of some of the characters yeah like uh... okay which is why when i if you go back uh... and i suggest you go to battleshipretention.com and look up my review from back when it came out i don't say i'm very cagey in that review about the plot when i read your review i remember i didn't i don't think i use the word cagey to myself but i i remember thinking like
4477.774,4481.682," It's kind of, I mean, I get his vibe."
4481.802,4486.191,"I understand what the film feels like and that David liked it, but I really don't."
4487.455,4514.084, know what it's about yeah and that and part of me if I think I think I do that I've this is kind of off topic but I have like forced myself because I told you when I write reviews I outline them first and now I force myself at some point to put a note in there that says plot because I found that I will often write reviews that are that and I don't know this is necessarily a bad thing but don't give any sense of what the actual story of the movie is
4514.565,4516.391," Yes, I find that I do that as well."
4516.491,4518.458,I will either give way too much plot
4519.681,4522.222," And then a paragraph of, yeah, and this is what I thought of it."
4522.803,4529.426,"Or it's just a sentence, and then it's like, and here's the absolute minutia that no one finds important."
4529.906,4544.474,"But yeah, I think Midnight in Paris is a good example of what you're talking about, and that it does, it is still, it remains a comedy throughout, so that doesn't change, but I won't say what"
4545.454,4554.524," layered on About twenty five minutes, and I won't say that but it does it very well who's funnier in the movie Michael Sheen or Adrian Brody I?"
4554.564,4555.785,Think Sheen person.
4555.805,4559.269,"I think he is too, but Adrian Brody only really has one scene."
4559.69,4563.113,"Yeah, he knocks it out of the park Yeah, it is a great scene."
4563.313,4565.656,He never struck struck me as a type that would be good at comedy
4567.523,4573.826," Well, we have to wrap up because your other co-host for your other podcast is here."
4573.846,4574.927,"I'm sorry, my ten-fifteen is here."
4576.808,4579.53,"So, well, that was a good segue."
4579.55,4584.792,"I mentioned BattleshipPretension.com, which is where you should go, as always, for reviews."
4586.033,4607.743, now that the friday before this episode came out there wasn't a whole lot coming on the theater i don't think we actually have any new reviews for that week but of course there's always uh... you know uh... features and and all the reviews and home video reviews and all that kind of stuff but um... this coming week the thirteenth there's all all kinds of stuff uh... well uh...
4608.923,4618.09," I know Lynn Ramsey's We Need to Talk About Kevin, which has been out here for a few weeks, opens much wider this Friday, so go and search for that review."
4618.431,4623.895,"We'll have a review of Thelita Lloyd's, I'm not sure if I'm saying that right, The Iron Lady."
4624.355,4625.316,We'll have a review of
4626.457,4629.458, Baltazar Kormakor's Contraband.
4631.558,4643.761,"And I mentioned the director's name specifically because I didn't realize that he directed it, and I've seen two of his Icelandic films, One on One Reykjavik, which I liked a lot, and The Sea, which I kind of liked."
4644.882,4649.143,"Anyway, so I'm weirdly interested in Contraband, which is a"
4650.163,4659.508," January release that I hadn't given any thought to until earlier today when I realized that you give any I give no thoughts to January releases I'm a little interested in haywire, but yeah, mostly."
4659.568,4659.828,"Oh, hey."
4659.848,4659.948,What?
4659.988,4660.128,Yeah.
