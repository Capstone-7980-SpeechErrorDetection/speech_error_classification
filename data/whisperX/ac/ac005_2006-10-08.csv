13.974,21.096,"I'm Fraser Cain, I'm the publisher of Universe Today, and with me as always is Dr. Pamela Gay, a professor with Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville."
21.597,22.397,"Hi Pamela, how you doing?"
22.887,23.487, I'm doing well.
23.548,24.508,"How are you doing, Fraser?"

56.589,62.492,"There's a link attached to every story, so if you have any further questions we can help answer, that would be great."
63.333,66.715,"Alright, so last week we talked about dark matter, thanks to popular demand."
67.915,71.697," There was still popular demand for another subject, and that's the Big Bang."
72.458,75.219,So we thought we would tackle it this week.
75.72,76.68,"So what's your plan, Pamela?"
77.181,93.29,"Well, I think a good place to start is at the beginning, or in this case, at the beginning of the universe, and just give a broad overview of what the Big Bang was, what happened, and then we'll come back and look at each of the little details in detail."
93.87,95.471,"All right, let's go."
96.272,100.773," So in the beginning, there was a time zero."
100.793,102.114,And we don't know what happened before.
102.394,103.654,We don't know what triggered it.
104.474,107.395,Those aren't so much questions that science knows how to answer.
107.455,112.416,But we know that there was a time at which everything just sort of sprung out of a singularity.
112.857,121.699,Everything that is everything in our entire universe was at that first moment compressed down to a single point.
123.07,124.893," And when you compress things, they get hot."
125.594,129.38,"And when matter gets hot enough, it becomes pure energy."
130.142,131.464,Matter is just frozen energy.
132.325,136.191,"And at that first moment of the universe, everything was pure energy."
137.134,138.935, and was expanding outwards.
139.395,142.235,"At that first moment, all of the forces were one force."
142.416,146.457,"Gravity, electromagnetism, all of the forces were tied together."
147.477,159.26,"And then a gazillionth of a second, or technically ten to the negative thirty-fifth of a second later, the different forces fell apart and suddenly we did have gravity, we did have electromagnetic force."
160.46,161.981,But everything was still energy.
162.501,165.183, And then quarks began to form and gluons began to form.
166.224,168.045,Matter's just frozen energy.
168.665,175.45,And the most basic of particles are the quarks that combine to form protons and neutrons.
176.51,188.598,"And as the universe continued to expand and cool, we eventually reached a point where we did start to get normal particles, like the protons that we're used to that make up you, me, and the table that you and I are sitting at."
189.699,199.245," But those protons were still really high energy, and it was sort of like being in the center of a star, except the entire universe was like being in the center of a star."
200.005,204.107,"And there were actually nuclear reactions going on, and we had helium forming."
205.348,209.13,And everything continued to expand and cool down.
210.231,216.395,"And eventually, everything cooled off enough that atoms that were neutral could form."
216.415,218.396,We could get neutral hydrogen atoms.
219.631,226.997," And at that point, all the exciting stuff shut off until stars began to form a few hundred thousand years later and galaxies began to form."
227.778,230.72,And that was when the universe started to look like what it's doing today.
230.74,233.282,"And that's a really big, broad overview."
233.503,241.829,"But the basic story is take everything, compress it down really tiny, and then let it go and watch it cool and expand and cool and expand."
242.39,244.411,"Now, what actually drove the expansion?"
244.532,247.474,What's sort of the force that's pushing it outward?
247.967,251.889, I'm not sure force is quite the right way to think of it.
252.709,256.431,It's like the pressure in a can of compressed gas.
256.631,261.773,You remove the walls from the can and the gas in the can expands outwards.
262.393,264.634,But that gas expands out into something.
265.274,267.515,"In this case, the universe just expanded."
268.395,272.497,It wasn't so much expanding into anything as it just expanded.
272.817,276.919,"It was driven in part by the temperatures, but beyond that we can't really"
277.526,288.153, say trying to figure out what drove the expansion is still a problem that we have because the universe is still expanding apart and we're not quite sure what's driving that expansion.
289.234,294.437,"And we're not talking explosion here, we're actually talking like everything in the universe is spreading apart, right?"
295.123,298.145," Yeah, it's a complicated thing to try and imagine."
298.665,306.59,"It's sort of like if you take a piece of graph paper and you put it in the Xerox machine, you can expand it so that the squares get bigger and bigger and bigger."
307.69,309.972,"Now, that's sort of what happened to our early universe."
312.393,315.296, areas between two things got bigger and bigger and bigger.
315.576,319.981,But that piece of graph paper that you're expanding in your Xerox machine has edges.
320.641,325.727,Now imagine that you had some magical Mobius graph paper that had absolutely no edge.
326.687,328.149,And it was expanding outwards.
328.79,336.177,And you have in your mind a weird representation of what that early universe and what our universe today continues to be this
336.79,343.558, expanding geometry that has no edge and it's not so much expanding into anything as it's just expanding.
343.718,358.134,And so our galaxy might be along one of the lines of that graph paper expanding and then maybe our nearby galaxy is on one of those other lines of the graph paper and so that's why we see it going away from us just because the squares are just getting bigger and bigger.
359.216,359.816, Exactly.
359.936,364.097,"The stuff that's gravitationally bound together, it's not going to change in size."
364.378,370.019,So our galaxy is one giant gravitationally bound thing.
370.739,373.32,So you and I aren't getting further away from each other right now.
373.74,379.882,"As much as your wife or my husband may accuse us of getting bigger heads, our heads are staying the same size."
381.102,383.603,So how is the Big Bang turned up in the first place?
384.844,398.768," Well, historically, it started out at the beginning of the last century with Einstein sitting down and coming up with his theories of relativity, which mathematically said that the universe should either be expanding or contracting."
399.308,401.789,"And he went, oh, no, no, that's bad."
401.909,405.47,Our universe is the way it is.
405.65,406.83,It's a static system.
407.05,410.651,"And so he added a constant, the cosmological constant instilled the universe."
411.001,411.842," But nobody knew, right?"
411.882,416.006,"He just said, that's the way we've always thought it was, so I'm going with that."
416.687,422.472,Even scientists are somewhat driven by their philosophical underpinnings to the way they see the world.
422.732,435.285,"If you anticipate that the universe isn't moving, and your equations say that it is, and you don't have any evidence, and they didn't at that point, saying what the universe is doing, you can pretty much make your theory do whatever you want."
435.905,442.886, So he created a constant which allowed him to stop the universe from either expanding or contracting mathematically.
443.707,457.249,"But a few years later, there were observations done out at Lowell Observatory by a man named Vesto Slipher that showed the majority of the galaxies that we can see are moving away from us."
458.47,460.07,And this implies a couple of different things.
461.32,476.24," Either we're in a very unique place that causes everything to be moving away from us, like we've got some sort of a bad odor, or the universe is designed in such a way that no matter which galaxy you are, you see everything is moving away from you."
477.759,485.167," Now, part of science says we can't ever assume that there's something special about when or where we are."
485.487,493.896,"We have to assume that the planet Earth, the Milky Way galaxy we live in, everything is absolutely average standard normal."
495.151,501.598," So that leaves the idea that no matter where you're standing, you have to see all the galaxies as moving away."
501.738,508.765,"I could move to a galaxy a hundred million light years away, and I'd still see everything as moving away."
508.885,513.469,"I could move to a galaxy three billion light years away, and I'd still see everything as moving away."
514.25,517.834,"Well, that can happen if you live in an expanding universe."
519.055,524.44, Imagine you're some microbe on a raisin in a loaf of raisin bread.
525.281,530.766,"When the loaf is small and just set out on the cupboard to rise, all the raisins are nearby."
531.326,537.592,"But as the bread dough expands, you see all the raisins moving further and further away from you."
538.392,542.596,And it's not that they're moving away from you as the space between you and them
543.519,548.562, is expanding and they're getting carried further away in the expanding space.
549.422,551.384,And that's the universe we live in.
551.524,555.646,It's a loaf of expanding raisin bread and we're just a microbe hanging out.
556.226,560.168,And so how was the discovery sort of further discovered?
561.857,577.573," Well, a man by the name of Edwin Hubble, for whom the Hubble Space Telescope is named, looked at Vesto Slipher's results and then went and took some more data of his own, and he realized that the further away a galaxy is from us,"
578.454,587.283," the faster it's moving away from us, which was the mathematical evidence needed to say, yes, it is an expanding universe."
588.384,589.726,And that was the start of it all.
590.226,595.792,"And then mathematics were built up around that to explain, well, what are the consequences of this?"
596.974,597.214, Right.
597.394,614.022,"And so this week, we've got the Nobel Prize that has that's been won by by two Americans that worked on the Kobe satellite, which was the one of the satellites that searched for the the cosmic microwave background radiation."
614.702,623.626,"So we were thinking that this week, we talked about one of the big lines of evidence for the Big Bang, which is this discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation."
623.726,625.947,So let's go back to the beginning.
627.063,640.756, So Hubble comes out with his results and these are results that did get used by John C. Mathers and George Smoot to promote the building of the COBE satellite and the analysis of its data.
641.368,642.629, Hubble came up with his results.
643.309,644.529,The universe is expanding.
644.91,652.873,"Well, if something's expanding, that implies that at some point in the past it was much smaller and denser, and you can trace it backwards."
653.974,665.058,And a man by the name of Lemaitre worked out Einstein's theories to figure out what are the mathematical implications of this expanding universe.
665.158,670.801,"Well, first you erase Einstein's cosmological constant, which has since come back, but that's a story for a later day."
671.902,677.066," And he said, okay, so once upon a time, our universe had to be much smaller."
677.786,684.311,"Well, when you take gas, when you take matter, when you take all the stuff that's in our universe and you compress it down, you make it hot."
685.072,687.674,"You keep compressing it, it gets hotter and hotter and hotter."
688.755,692.578,"And he worked through the implications of this and realized that at some point,"
693.638,705.985," All of the matter was so dense that when a bit of light tried to move from point A to point B, it couldn't help but interact with the electrons and protons of the early universe."
707.506,709.247,More people came and worked on that.
709.347,714.61,"He was working, I believe, in the late twenties, early thirties, and then another team"
715.69,722.975," with the great name of Alpha, Beta and Gamma came along and studied the problem more in the forties."
723.756,735.103,And they kept working on this and eventually built up this detailed picture that said that all the energy and matter were interacting with one another.
736.104,744.71,And then they cooled to a point that all of a sudden the atoms could just hang out by themselves and be isolatory and the light could go flying off in whatever direction it wanted.
745.45,746.552, So what would that look like then?
746.572,747.454,I'm trying to understand.
747.474,752.042,You've got all the matter and all the light just kind of bouncing into each other.
752.062,752.844,What would that look like?
753.052,765.745," Well, so take a fluorescent light tube, take it out of its case, take the cover off of the casing so you just have the light bulb, and very carefully put a comic strip behind it or something."
765.845,771.15,"And if you have a mostly clear tube, you can look through the tube and see the comic strip behind the tube."
771.991,775.895,"Now when you turn on that light, you can no longer see through the tube."
776.856,796.75," Well, what's happening is inside the tube, because you have the electricity flowing through it, you have all of the electrons are jumping around between energy states, and they're emitting light as they're doing this, and the light that's trying to get through the tube is constantly interacting with the electrons, and everything becomes completely opaque."
797.55,802.854,"So you have this glowing, can't-be-seen-through hot gas."
803.534,805.336,"Well, that's what the early universe looked like."
806.116,814.225," And then at a certain point, it cooled off enough that it was just like when you shut off the light's electricity, when you turn off the switch."
814.946,819.791,"Now you can see through the bulb again, and you can see that comic strip that you've stuck behind the bulb."
821.167,829.115," At that moment, all the light gets sent off running about your room and you can see through the tube."
829.996,844.351,"Now, if you had extra ultra mega huge high speed cameras, you could see that light coming off of the light bulb when you shut off the electricity come out and just sort of in a packet fly across the room."
845.39,854.838," Well, that same light from the moment that the universe cooled off enough, that the light and the matter stopped interacting directly, is still bouncing around the universe."
855.919,858.081,And it has a specific temperature.
858.922,868.23,"So if we had a big enough telescope, we could look out to the very edges of the universe and see that light in all directions, right?"
868.25,869.651,Because you're looking back in time.
869.671,872.954,"So if you look far enough back in time, you would see in all directions that light, right?"
873.579,879.963," And in fact, it's not so much a big enough telescope as a telescope capable of seeing in the right colors."
880.743,887.447,"In fact, your television antenna is, at a certain level, a big enough telescope."
887.467,898.593,"Because when you see static in your television, part of that static that you're seeing is light from the moment when the universe cooled off enough that the photons could go flying off on their own."
898.613,900.614,"OK, so how is my television seeing light?"
902.571,907.774," Well, this is one of those things where our language is hiding things from us."
908.055,917.681,We talk about our television and our radio and what we see with our eyes as though they're three entirely different things.
918.462,922.544,"When you turn on your microwave, you're shooting light at your food."
923.185,929.309,"When you turn on your television, you're intercepting light with your TV antenna."
929.589,932.531,"With the TV, it's light that's off"
932.891,934.012, in radio frequencies.
934.152,942.057,"It's so red that it's beyond what you can see with your eyes, beyond what Arnold Schwarzenegger can see with night vision goggles in movies."
942.258,946.601,"It's red, red, red in the radio spectrum."
947.801,952.244,And then our microwave is a little bit less red.
952.685,956.407,It's microwave length radiation.
956.547,956.667,It's
958.349,962.115, We talk about things by the lengths of their waves.
962.356,966.863,"Radio waves can have waves that are meters, kilometers in length."
968.197,970.359," Microwaves, it's a micrometer."
971.339,977.043,"Then when we get into stuff that we can see with our eyes, it's nanometer radiation."
977.664,980.986,"And x-ray, that's just another color of light."
981.806,988.111,"Everything that we're dealing with, whether it be our cell phone antenna, it's looking at one color of light."
988.631,992.974,"Our wireless routers in our houses, that's just another color of light."
994.028,1001.839," So how did this original glow that was once just sort of, I don't know what color it was, move from that to microwaves?"
1002.25,1007.935," Well, originally it was really, really hot and thus had a really blue, blue, blue color."
1008.756,1017.965,"Every little kid that draws blue as cold and red as hot actually has his science backwards, but we don't need to explain this to five-year-olds."
1018.966,1020.887,"Blue is actually really, really hot."
1021.087,1027.393,"If you watch Captain Kirk on an old Star Trek episode, Heat Up Iraq, it goes from red to blue eventually."
1028.294,1036.101," So originally we had this really hot, really, really blue light that was emitted as the universe cooled."
1036.961,1042.947,"And as the universe has continued to expand, all the energy that was given off at that moment"
1043.747,1049.051, has had to stretch out to fill the universe as the universe has continued to expand.
1049.551,1060.76,"So we went from having this really blue light in a hot, dense universe to now we have this really, really red microwave light that fills a much bigger universe."
1061.44,1063.181," So, hold on, let me see if I can get this."
1064.002,1089.578,"So as the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, the actual light itself that's been bouncing around has actually stretched out, because I guess the point is that the photons that we're seeing from that very beginning, those very photons have kind of stretched out to fill the space between what they started out with and matching the size of the universe now."
1090.459,1097.067," It's, it's, the energy has to fill up the space and there's no new energy coming into the system."
1097.628,1102.954,"So light, which is just energy, has to stretch out to fill the expanding universe."
1103.815,1108.02,"And so that's why the wavelengths, when they started out in the nanometers, now they're in the micrometers."
1108.664,1109.204, Exactly.
1110.525,1117.907,"And so this was figured out, I believe, in the sixties by a group out of Princeton."
1118.727,1120.488,It was led by a man named Dickey.
1121.488,1129.251,"And he worked out mathematically exactly what color the radiation should be today, having figured out when he thought the Big Bang might have been."
1129.851,1132.092,And he started building a Dickey radiometer.
1133.032,1147.9," And at the same time that he was working on building his device to go look for his radiation, there was a group working at Bell Labs, Penzias and Wilson, who were going to do astronomy of a different sort, but were also building a Dickey radiometer."
1148.741,1157.185,"And they finished theirs first, and they started to do their astronomy program, and they had this really annoying noise in the background of their research."
1158.346,1163.03, And so they did everything a good scientists do.
1163.11,1168.614,"They fussed with their equipment, fussed with their equipment, made sure their equipment was absolutely perfect."
1168.714,1172.236,"They looked at their equipment, realized there were pigeons living in their equipment."
1172.357,1178.561,"They evicted the pigeons living in their equipment and cleaned up the things the pigeons left behind in their equipment, as pigeons do."
1179.782,1186.787,"And when their equipment was completely clean, completely fixed, everything checked out perfectly, and the noise was still there,"
1187.908,1195.174," Rather than just saying, well, we can't find it and moving on with life, they said this must have some sort of a physical cause."
1195.194,1201.659,And they started looking around to see what science could explain this weird noise in the background of their data.
1202.92,1210.006,And Dickie up at Princeton got word of what was going on and stopped building his equipment and there was much talking.
1210.906,1217.09, And Penzias and Wilson found out that they had discovered the cosmic microwave background.
1217.57,1228.037,They had discovered this leftover light from the moment that the universe cooled off enough that the light could go flying off on its own and the neutral hydrogen was formed.
1228.41,1241.0," And so their detector was actually seeing the shifted wavelength, I guess, of this original hot light now in the microwave spectrum."
1241.36,1245.984,They were seeing the cooled off energy from the Big Bang.
1246.644,1252.668," Pretty neat discovery, and Penzias and Wilson actually went on and got a Nobel Prize for their discovery."
1253.829,1262.594,"There were a lot of bitter theorists who'd done a lot of hard mathematical work and didn't get a Nobel Prize, but the history books remember everyone that was involved."
1263.692,1268.055," And so, and so there's one of the great lines of evidence for the Big Bang."
1268.495,1279.782,"The prediction was that if the Big Bang was right, and if the universe was at this singular point, you know, the small point in the past, you would see this microwave background radiation."
1280.363,1282.764,"And, you know, voila, they found it."
1283.105,1283.585,They found it.
1284.305,1288.568,"So now there was more work done with the microwave background radiation over time, right?"
1288.928,1289.949,And that's where the Kobe comes in.
1290.592,1298.059," So the original discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background, they were using fairly limited technology."
1298.139,1303.345,Trying to see microwave waves through our atmosphere is not the easiest thing in the world.
1303.405,1305.847,What you really want to do is get above our atmosphere.
1307.028,1308.77,There were balloon experiments done.
1310.651,1318.775," And it all pointed to the background light was basically the exact same temperature, no matter what direction you looked in."
1319.815,1331.521,This meant that the material that formed the background radiation was all the exact same temperature at the moment that the neutral hydrogen formed.
1331.581,1336.263,This implies that the whole universe went cold at the exact same moment as well.
1338.931,1346.175," Any time you imagine the entire universe doing the exact same thing at the exact same time, you have to say, wow, am I really seeing that?"
1346.195,1348.977,Because that's a lot of stuff to do the same thing all at once.
1350.038,1360.324,"So scientists carefully measured over and over and over, trying to get the most exact measurements of how consistent the color of the background radiation was."
1363.43,1371.072," To do it right, it was realized we really need to launch a satellite, map the entire thing all at once, consistently with the same instrument."
1372.012,1388.215,"And this was where Smoot and Mathers came in, is they spearheaded the building and then the operation and analysis of the COBE satellite, which was the first satellite to go up and map the entire cosmic microwave background radiation."
1389.235,1398.804, They found that the entire background was exactly the same color to one part in a hundred thousand.
1399.925,1408.592,"That says that, yeah, to one part in a hundred thousand, the entire universe did the exact same thing at the exact same time in the exact same way."
1408.672,1410.694,And that's pretty cool when you think about it.
1411.246,1423.25," So the universe, I don't know how long of a time that was, but the universe just went from hot gas or opaque gas to transparent gas at the exact same time."
1423.55,1423.81, Yeah.
1424.571,1442.5,"There are some very slight variations, these one part in a hundred thousand variations, where there were sections that were a little bit hotter, there were sections that were a little bit colder, and these temperature variations lead to color variations, and they also imply that there were density variations."
1443.18,1454.182," So there were places that were a little bit more dense, places that were a little less dense, and we can see that in these very careful maps of the color of the cosmic microwave background."
1455.462,1467.304,And what's cool is these very slight variations actually point to where we now have galaxy clusters and where we have emptiness in the universe today.
1467.884,1470.965,So these slight irregularities that we see in the background
1471.625,1476.829, point to where all the structures in our modern universe would eventually be forming.
1478.13,1479.191,So those are pretty important then.
1479.491,1481.032,Those are very important.
1481.052,1485.536,"In fact, those are probably worth an entire episode just to themselves."
1485.596,1500.127,"And it was these, we call them anisotropies, these variations in the background that have been getting the most attention in recent days because it's from these slight variations that we can figure out how our universe today is expanding"
1501.537,1505.703, We can figure out how much matter there is in the universe compared to energy.
1506.544,1509.608,Very small things can sometimes have really huge implications.
1510.59,1516.979,"And the COBE was followed up by the WMAP satellite that was launched just a few years ago and sort of did the same thing, right?"
1517.515,1520.797," Right, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe."
1521.877,1543.647,"It went up, and it had more sensitivity than COBE had, and went in, and they were able to measure that the temperature of the background radiation is two point seven two eight degrees above absolute zero, above the temperature at which atoms just stop moving, plus or minus point zero zero four degrees."
1544.187,1562.103," So they made an extremely accurate map in very high detail, looking at the distribution of the sizes of these irregularities to see how many big irregularities there were, how many small irregularities there were, how many of them were a little hotter, how many of them were a little bit colder."
1563.464,1576.43," And there'd been theorists who'd said, well, we expect based on the current distribution of matter in the visible universe that the background should have the following numbers of irregularities of these given sizes."
1576.47,1579.411,So there are all these theories making all these predictions of what should be seen.
1580.571,1585.315, And what was cool was WMAP exactly matched some of the theories.
1585.895,1593.32,"And they were able to say this set of theories, this specific theoretical model of our universe is correct."
1593.901,1600.065,And it was also able to say the universe is thirteen point seven billion years old plus or minus point two billion.
1600.782,1605.064, And that's where we're getting that thirteen point seven billion that I think we all use now for the age of the universe.
1605.164,1606.425,It all comes from WMAP.
1606.645,1607.285,From WMAP.
1607.505,1609.866,And that was only come up like three or four years ago.
1610.066,1614.088,That came out in either late two thousand two or early two thousand three.
1615.089,1616.49,It's all new results.
1617.01,1618.991,"When I was in graduate school, which"
1619.691,1621.313, I finished in two thousand and two.
1622.114,1636.373,"We were still talking about how we don't know the age of things, how there were still all these weird contradictions where when you tried to measure things one way you ended up with the stars older than the universe and when you tried to measure it other ways you couldn't figure out when galaxies formed."
1637.666,1655.475," One satellite solved all those problems, and that one satellite was the culmination of LeMontrier starting in the year of his work, and the work done in the nineteen forties by Alpha, Beta and Gamoff, mostly by Gamoff, and then the nineteen sixty-five observations by Penzias and Wilson."
1656.656,1664.669, This was then culminated in the COBE satellite with Mathers and Smoot and then finally in the WMAP satellite named after Wilkinson.
1665.51,1667.994,So science just builds one thing on top of another.
1668.972,1670.873, And we're only partway done.
1670.913,1684.099,"I think we've run out of time for this week, but we've got the Big Bang and we've got one very important line of evidence that people know how we know about the Big Bang and how we know that the universe started from singularity."
1684.139,1687.241,But I guess there's more lines of evidence that we'll talk about next week.
1688.041,1691.502,You can never say something is true if you only have one piece of evidence.
1692.163,1693.343,We have more than one.
1693.363,1694.704,We know the Big Bang is true.
1695.814,1697.055," Well, thank you very much, Pamela."
1697.115,1698.556,We'll talk to you next week.
