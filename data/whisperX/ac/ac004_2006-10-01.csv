5.208,9.682," AstronomyCast Episode Four for Monday, October second, two thousand and six."
10.224,11.729,The search for dark matter.
13.263,21.189," I'm Fraser Cain from Universe Today, and with me again, as always, is Dr. Pamela Gay, professor at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville."
21.829,26.613,"You're listening to Astronomy Cast, which is our weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos."
27.353,32.777,"Our goal is to let you know not only what we know, but how we know what we know."
33.578,35.659,"So, hi Pamela, how are you doing this week?"
36.12,37.2,"I'm doing great, Fraser."
37.22,37.901,How are you doing?
38.63,64.453, very well and you should hear some stats we've got um we're up to episode three i guess this is episode four but we've had uh twenty five thousand listeners per show since we got things rolling so that's uh that's really good thanks to everybody who's subscribed uh if you haven't subscribed don't worry our our server can handle the bandwidth so uh you know more more people listening is would be just great
65.293,72.216," If you haven't subscribed yet, you can go to AstronomyCast.com and there's a link up at the top that has an RSS link."
72.236,74.437,You can put that into your podcatching software.
74.517,79.759,"And we're also in iTunes, so you can just do a search in iTunes for AstronomyCast and you'll get us."
80.519,88.088," You can send us any comments or questions, feedback, to info at astronomycast.com and you can also join the discussion forums."
88.108,92.994,There's a link on every show on our site that takes you to the discussion forums and you can join in.
93.374,95.497,"Now, Pamela, you had a message for educators as well."
95.962,96.282, I did.
96.543,105.772,So we're doing this with the idea that these are discussions that are a level that anyone with an interest in astronomy should be able to follow what we're talking about.
106.032,117.803,"So get out there and tell your favorite teacher, tell that astronomy professor whom you love about our show so that they can add it to their list of curriculum resources to draw upon when they're putting together their classes."
117.923,120.446,And maybe they can even get their students listening to our shows.
120.785,136.956, And the other thing is that one of our plans is that we wanted every fifth or so show to actually turn around and take some of your questions and talk to some professional astronomers and space scientists and pass your questions along to them.
137.056,148.084,"But we don't have enough questions yet, so if you have questions about anything, space, astronomy, anything, email them to us and we'll try and package that up into a show."
148.904,156.709," So, now we've had three weeks of information on planets, both Pluto's planet hood and extrasolar planets."
157.23,158.771,"What, had enough planets?"
159.151,159.651,What's next?
160.091,164.134,"Well, everyone seems to be asking us about dark matter, so let's turn to dark matter."
164.974,173.82,"Well, it's actually quite timely because we had some recent, quite a few recent news stories about direct evidence of dark matter that was discovered."
173.92,176.882,"So, we'll kind of get back to that at some point."
177.479,178.34, That's exactly right.
178.4,189.407,"There was a recent observation of dark matter where we couldn't see the dark matter directly, but we could directly see the effects that it had on background light."
190.448,194.23,Light is yanked around the universe by gravity just like masses.
194.831,199.074,"And the ballet cluster, which is a merger of two different galaxy clusters,"
199.834,209.701, bent the light of background objects in such a way that we were able to trace out the distribution of mass and see directly that there was more mass there than we can see.
211.302,214.504,"Well, let's go back to the beginning first and kind of lay the foundation."
214.544,218.046,So of how was dark matter discovered in the first place?
218.345,238.863," Well, Fritz Zwicky, who is perhaps most famous for coining the term spherical bastards to describe people who are a bastard from any direction, back in the year of the comet was studying the velocities of galaxies in the coma cluster, which is a large nearby cluster of a bazillion galaxies."
238.883,240.965,There's beautiful Hubble images of this.
242.026,252.152," And in looking at how the galaxies were moving in relation to one another, he realized that some of them were moving a thousand kilometers per second faster than they should be."
252.592,259.796,"If this was a bound system, these velocities implied that there had to be more mass than we knew about."
260.397,265.78,"Otherwise, the galaxies would be flying randomly out of the galaxy cluster in all directions."
266.7,269.903," So, he said, there's got to be mass here we can't see."
269.983,272.384,And he proposed dark matter and everyone ignored him.
272.785,286.974,"So I kind of imagine in the situation some almost like flies buzzing around a central light, you know, like moss going around a center light at night, you know, that something's keeping them sort of in the same place."
287.034,292.298,"And if there wasn't this extra mass, then they should just be just flown away."
292.944,293.444, Exactly.
293.804,296.825,So gravity keeps things tied together.
297.125,301.826,"If the gravity from the earth went away, the moon would go shooting off in a straight line."
302.547,305.627,"If we increase the velocity of the moon, its orbit will change."
305.788,310.389,"If we increase the velocity of the moon a lot, it will also fly off into space."
311.309,324.196," Well, with a cluster of galaxies, when we look at the velocities of the galaxies in the cluster, those velocities reflect how much mass there has to be in the system that's keeping them tied there."
324.957,335.923,"If there's not enough mass and we see a really high velocity, that galaxy is either going to shoot out of the cluster or there has to be mass we can't see that's allowing it to stay in."
336.683,339.985,"If we see just one galaxy that's going too fast, well, maybe it's a"
340.365,343.767, galaxy that's not part of the cluster that just happens to be zipping through it.
344.407,353.191,"But when you see tens and twenties of galaxies that are going way too fast, it implies there's definitely mass there that we can't see."
354.191,357.113,And that's what Fritz saw.
357.213,358.033,And nobody believed him?
358.153,358.813,Not initially.
359.213,361.915,It took thirty years before there was more evidence.
362.675,369.058,A woman by the name of Vera Rubin looked at edge-on spiral galaxies and measured the rotation rates.
369.952,373.794, And she found that stars aren't orbiting galaxies the way they're supposed to either.
374.194,381.698,"What she discovered was, what we expect is the further things are from the center of a galaxy, the slower they should be going."
381.998,387.401,"So if you make a plot of velocity versus distance from the center of a galaxy,"
388.681,392.002," the velocities should eventually drop down, drop down, drop down."
392.142,392.583,They don't.
393.203,394.343,"Instead, they flatten out."
395.203,404.527,"So in the outer parts of a galaxy, the stars are all going the same speed as you get to higher and higher distances from the center."
405.367,417.511,And this makes absolutely no sense unless there's invisible matter that is becoming a larger and larger fraction of the galaxy's total mass as you get to larger and larger radius.
418.494,425.503," So sorry, if there was just the mass that we can see in the galaxy, what would the stars do?"
425.523,429.167,They would rotate around the galaxy.
429.227,435.435,They would orbit around the galaxy with slower velocities the further from the center of the galaxy you get.
437.651,444.214," And because there is additional matter that we can't see, it's more like they're all going the same speed."
444.254,448.577,They're rotating like a solid disk instead of like a bunch of individual objects.
449.737,449.957,Right.
450.117,450.378,Okay.
450.778,458.762,"So if you think about it, if you have a solid disk and you draw a line on it, all the points on that line rotate around the center at the exact same rate."
459.062,459.442, perfect.
459.523,468.152,"And that and that if the dark matter wasn't there, or the extra digital matter wasn't there, then it would it would more be like that line would be curving back over time."
468.232,468.793,Exactly.
468.833,470.535,"Okay, like the parts?"
471.075,471.396,Yes.
472.597,472.877,Got it.
473.238,473.458,Yes.
474.319,474.559,Okay.
476.462,477.562, Proceed.
479.503,483.164,So Vera Rubin was working with a fellow by the name of Kent Ford.
484.044,489.186,"And they went and they measured the rotation rates of edge on galaxies, not just one, but several."
489.886,491.166,And they were doing this in the one.
491.366,496.688,"And in one, she finally came out and said at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society,"
497.949,500.132, These things aren't rotating the way they're supposed to.
500.332,510.383,"There's got to be some sort of dark matter, dark mass that we can't see that forms a halo around the visible part of galaxies."
511.344,515.989,"She did mathematics to show if you add invisible mass in this proportion,"
517.01,523.472," where the amount gets larger and larger with larger radius, then we can simulate what we're actually observing."
524.272,528.593,So dark matter is just our way of saying there's stuff here we can't see.
530.094,532.934,"We're not saying what it is, we're just saying we can't see it."
533.254,535.395,"And now the evidence is mounted up over time, right?"
535.797,536.298, Exactly.
536.818,543.045,"So as we look at more and more spiral galaxies, we see that they're not rotating the way they should."
543.346,547.57,"As we look at more and more galaxy clusters, we see that things aren't orbiting the way they should."
548.311,553.898,"As we look at things merging together, the way the objects fall into the core of the"
554.478,559.083," colliding galaxies or the colliding clusters, they're not falling in the way they should."
560.305,568.955,"In fact, the way our entire universe is evolving implies that there's mass out there that altered the way the universe was born."
569.355,588.14," This is where cold dark matter models come in, where we say that originally there had to be something slow moving that exerted gravitational effects that slowed down the interactions of the hotter normal particles that were able to form galaxies and stars because of it."
588.46,589.561,"Okay, so we can't see it."
589.841,590.301,So what is it?
591.812,593.415," Yeah, I wish I knew that exactly."
594.457,597.102,Pretty much everyone wishes they knew what it was exactly.
597.703,600.729,"I was just hoping maybe, maybe you'd figured it out, but I guess, you know."
601.009,603.874,"Yeah, no, it's not enough coffee this morning, I guess."
605.009,613.456," So there's theories, there's the idea that perhaps it's stuff that we just can't see, but is normal everyday stuff."
613.816,625.685,"Like, we call this baryonic matter, any matter that's made up of three quarks that defines us, it defines our planet, anything that interacts normally, that's baryonic matter."
626.065,635.35," And we suspect there's some stuff out there we just can't see, like little tiny brown dwarfs, free-roaming planets, neutron stars, black holes."
636.09,638.471,We can't see this stuff all the time.
639.332,645.135,"Right, so anything that has mass but isn't necessarily bright."
645.415,645.915,Exactly.
646.335,646.815, Right.
646.855,654.52,"Like, for example, you know, people on Alpha Centauri wouldn't necessarily be able to see my car because, you know, it's not giving off light."
654.901,656.342,"But at the same time, you know, it's there."
656.382,656.982,It's massive.
657.162,658.903,It's participating in the universe.
659.183,659.644,Exactly.
659.824,665.367,"In fact, if you think about it, at one point, Neptune was dark matter."
666.148,674.973,"We were able to look at the orbit of Uranus and say, oh, there's got to be something else out there that's gravitationally affecting how this planet moves."
676.054,681.48," And anytime we can say there's something we can't see that has a gravitational effect, we're describing dark matter."
682.341,694.835,"Well, using a lot of mathematics, astronomers were able to predict the location, or at least two mathematicians were able to predict the location of where Neptune should be, and it was observed."
696.036,702.737," Now, today we're going out and we're saying, well, we think there's some stuff we can't see in the halo of the galaxy."
703.278,710.939,"So teams like the MACHO Project are going out and they're looking for, the MACHO Project is actually built out of an acronym."
711.919,720.421,"They're looking for Massive Compact Halo Objects, where if you take the MA for massive and then the CH and O from compact halo object, you get MACHO."
721.201,724.322,"So they're looking for black holes, neutron stars, brown dwarfs."
725.382,732.608," free roaming planets, by the way, their gravity affects the light of stars in the background and galaxies in the background."
732.708,747.781,"So the macho team is looking for macho regular stuff, regular stuff, yes, that we would we would be able to see it go Okay, yeah, that's mass that's matter, you know, maybe it's a black hole that it's completely, you know, baffling, but it's still something that we can kind of wrap our heads around."
747.941,748.362, Exactly.
748.422,751.806,"And they are finding it, but they're not finding it in huge amounts."
752.747,757.112,So we've identified about four percent of the mass in the universe.
758.073,761.477,There's another twenty two percent of mass that's dark matter.
762.779,766.163,Seventy four percent of the universe is dark energy and no one knows what dark energy is.
766.621,769.684," So that four, and we'll deal with dark energy on another show."
769.784,770.264,Exactly.
770.284,772.926,We need to completely blow people's minds this time around.
773.186,782.995,"But with that four percent, so that four percent includes both the stuff that's clearly obvious, but also estimated to be there, but we just can't necessarily see it."
783.735,784.236,Right.
784.696,788.239,So this leaves us looking for another twenty-two percent in the universe.
789.78,796.864," So a very small, small, small amount of this is going to be free-roaming planets, white dwarfs, black holes."
797.865,807.37,"But we know that this is a very, very small amount because when we do calculations on what happened during the Big Bang,"
808.03,813.855, we can match our theories to the observed elemental abundances in stars.
814.616,820.12,"When we look at really old stars, we see a certain amount of deuterium in the stars."
820.2,824.103,Deuterium is hydrogen that has an extra neutron in it.
825.585,830.889,"When we look at the deuterium abundance, deuterium only gets destroyed in nuclear reactions."
831.049,832.61,It doesn't get created anymore.
832.75,835.092,What we have was created in the Big Bang.
836.321,846.187," And if there was more normal matter, more baryonic matter than just a few more percent, then we wouldn't see as much deuterium as we see."
846.727,855.853,"So using lots of scary theory, lots of nucleosynthesis models during the Big Bang, we're able to say how much deuterium there should be."
855.893,858.474,We're able to say how much helium there should be.
859.415,864.498,And we're also able to see there should be a certain amount of dark matter that
864.998,867.56, we will never be able to see using normal methods.
867.6,869.282,This is the non-baryonic stuff.
869.842,870.022,Right.
870.082,870.403,Okay.
870.423,875.266,"So, so there's a certain amount of matter out there that we just can't see."
875.787,876.548,Just invisible.
876.788,877.248,Exactly.
877.488,880.411,We can only see it through its gravitational interactions.
881.071,881.972,So what is it?
882.192,884.974,"Well, for lack of a better term, we call it WIMPs."
885.535,888.257,These are weakly interacting massive particles.
888.697,890.939,"So we got machos, and we got WIMPs."
891.159,891.64,Exactly.
892.381,894.742," Not the most creatively named, but it's kind of humorous."
895.262,901.623,So weakly interacting massive particles are one of the holy grails of particle physics.
902.404,908.505,These are things that don't generally interact via the electromagnetic force.
909.245,915.127,"So they're not interacting with light, not doing any of the things that protons do oh so well."
916.527,918.808, And we're not sure what they are.
919.088,922.228,There's theories that they come out of supersymmetric particles.
922.348,924.709,"There's theories, all sorts of theories."
925.589,930.29,"Exactly what the truth is, is hopefully going to be figured out by the Large Hadron Collider."
930.53,934.971,It's going to come online in the not-too-distant future at CERN in Europe.
935.971,937.951,So we have this class of objects.
938.271,939.231,We call them WIMPs.
939.632,941.312,"And beyond that, we don't know much."
941.972,943.673, But there's also things like neutrinos.
944.474,947.417,Neutrinos don't generally like to interact.
947.497,950.719,They're the anti-social part of the particle world.
951.72,956.104,"And they're fast moving, have a small amount of mass, and they're non-baryonic."
956.524,958.946,"Our sun emits them, nuclear reactors emit them."
959.746,963.95,"They're out there, and they're going to be making up part of this dark matter constituency."
964.17,969.913," So do neutrinos have mass and interact with regular matter, like with gravity?"
969.993,971.394,They interact with gravity.
971.634,972.695,They do have mass.
973.495,979.599,"They don't like to interact, but when forced, they will interact in mines filled with cleaning solution."
980.159,981.92,But that's sort of a topic for another show.
982.58,987.363,"Now, if you added up all the estimated mass of neutrinos, does that do the trick?"
987.748,988.248, Not at all.
988.748,990.289,There have to be other things out there.
990.389,990.689,Also.
990.709,991.609,So what is it?
992.569,993.409,We don't know.
994.65,998.03,This is the part of particle physics where you write here be dragons.
1000.131,1002.091,There's nothing else to say.
1003.111,1003.851,There's theories.
1004.432,1010.073,This is one of those great unknown parts of science that makes an interesting time to be alive.
1010.193,1013.153,Anytime they say there's still no great questions.
1013.994,1015.674,Just look at dark matter and dark energy.
1016.167,1017.548, So are there any more ideas?
1017.568,1018.648,"Well, let's hear some more theories."
1018.948,1028.932,"Well, so there's this thing called modified Newtonian dynamics, which basically says, let's just throw out most of dark matter, and instead change our theory of gravity."
1029.833,1042.378,"The idea is that as you get to larger and larger separations between two masses, this extra term kicks in and modifies the attraction between two things."
1043.422,1051.476, It's a fascinating theory that came out by a guy named Mordechai Milgram in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year of his death in the year
1052.402,1056.524, It can't fully account for what's going on in clusters of galaxies.
1056.664,1060.446,It can't deal with the third peak in the cosmic microwave background.
1060.526,1075.153,"Basically, if you plot out the distribution of the sizes of the irregularities in the microwave background, you can get different acoustic waves."
1076.573,1081.737, And the first and second peak can be matched with modified Newtonian dynamics.
1081.777,1082.537,The third one can't.
1082.717,1086.5,All three peaks can be matched with cold dark matter models.
1086.94,1090.903,"So the main idea here... We're going to have to come back and explain some of that, but... In another show."
1091.163,1091.743,In another show.
1092.204,1098.568,So the main idea is MOND can't fully explain the way the cosmic microwave background looks.
1099.268,1103.031,"It can't explain clusters of galaxies, but it can explain everything else."
1104.15,1111.052," So with MOND, you're essentially saying the laws of gravity work differently on the large scales."
1111.132,1111.392,Yes.
1112.372,1124.536,"That what you see, what you think is gravity or not enough gravity from regular matter that's having to have some kind of dark matter, it's really just because you don't understand gravity properly."
1124.616,1125.076,Exactly.
1125.996,1143.949," And the thing about this that is a little bit scary is, as a scientist, I'm required to say that any time there are two theories and one of the theories fits my data better than the other theory, I have to go with the theory that fits my data better no matter how much I don't like it."
1144.87,1149.395, MOND is able to fit some stuff better than dark matter models.
1150.056,1161.369,"Specifically, there's this thing called the Tully-Fisher relationship that basically says that the rate at which a galaxy is rotating is directly related to how much light it gives off."
1162.742,1174.485, And this implies that the fraction of dark matter as a function of radius and the function of mass has to somehow magically be tweaked to always make this relationship work.
1175.486,1177.106,And that's kind of weird if you think about it.
1177.406,1183.068,It's sort of like saying you always have the exact same ratio of adults to children or something silly like that.
1184.028,1187.249,"But with MOND, they're able to look at their equations"
1188.329,1195.333, and empirically derive why galaxies rotation rates and luminosities match perfectly.
1196.954,1210.261,"So there's this weird back of the brain, ooh, I have to pay attention to this thing going on, where maybe we're looking at two different problems, maybe there is dark matter that we can't see, because"
1211.235,1213.157, MOND can't explain galaxy clusters.
1213.438,1217.362,It can't explain the cosmic microwave background.
1218.323,1226.072,But maybe there is also this other term to gravity that we don't understand that is explaining galaxy rotation rates.
1226.933,1231.558,And so what experiments are in the works that are going to help provide some light on dark matter?
1233.655,1235.737, We're always looking for more places to get data.
1236.117,1245.125,We are trying to find those weakly interacting massive particles using collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.
1245.345,1253.793,We are looking for gravitational lensing as a way to map out the mass and galaxy clusters more accurately.
1254.453,1262.78," We're constantly probing new size scales, looking to see, okay, so do we have dark matter in star clusters?"
1263.22,1273.648,"And the answer for the little tiny star clusters called globular clusters that swarm around our galaxy is no, there's not dark matter in globular clusters."
1274.509,1287.712," So we have to somehow come up with a unified theory that explains why some things have dark matter and some things don't, that somehow finds what this missing matter is and can explain it."
1288.432,1299.635,"Perhaps these weakly interacting massive particles are something we haven't figured out yet, and someone just needs to be creative enough and smart enough to predict what they are and give us a theory to look for them."
1300.168,1306.414," But I think, like I get a lot of email and I see this a lot on the forum, a lot of people just don't like it."
1306.574,1314.922,"Like they don't like it almost like, you know, because they don't understand it or because, you know, it doesn't make sense in their concept of reality."
1315.042,1318.405,"And I think that, you know, my answer is too bad."
1319.446,1320.848,Something is going on.
1320.948,1323.03,Something isn't matching out there.
1323.09,1325.312,There is evidence that there's something that we don't understand.
1325.832,1332.715," And just because we can't necessarily see it with our eyes, we can, you know, if you put on your gravity eyes, then it's as, you know, as clear as day."
1332.775,1338.717,"And I think a good example of that is, you know, you look at your fire and you don't see the heat coming off of it."
1338.957,1342.578,"But if you put your hand out, then you feel the infrared radiation."
1342.678,1345.079,"You can't see infrared radiation, but you sure can feel it."
1345.519,1348.4,"And that's, you know, a very similar analogy to what we're dealing with here."
1348.88,1353.782,"If you look at the universe with gravity eyes, then it's, you know, the dark matters everywhere."
1354.372,1358.173," We, as scientists, aren't allowed to have emotional responses."
1358.233,1358.854,We can't help it.
1358.874,1359.634,We're human beings.
1360.454,1369.177,"But our logic circuits require us to look at the universe and say, things aren't moving the way they're supposed to."
1370.098,1373.999,And the way things move is determined from gravity and mass.
1374.899,1381.402,"So either there's more mass out there, either we don't understand gravity, or both."
1383.022,1387.707, Most theories are going in the direction that dark matter is the way to go.
1388.168,1397.157,"And dark matter is right now the only thing that can explain what's happening in clusters, what's happening in galaxies."
1398.251,1406.453, There's a little bit of black magic going on in order to get rotation rates and luminosities to consistently come out with the Tully-Fisher relationship.
1407.173,1408.954,But the theory works everywhere.
1409.934,1415.255,"If it's a bit ungraceful, then there's this modified Newtonian dynamics thing taunting us in the corner."
1415.595,1421.057,And so what's this most recent discovery about the direct observation of dark matter?
1421.077,1423.978,"Because that's kind of a bit of a, you know, it's not entirely true."
1424.318,1425.358,But what did they see?
1426.673,1428.634," Well, so gravity bends light."
1429.255,1444.344,"If I have a nice spiral galaxy in the background and I put a distribution of mass in front of it, its image is going to get distorted in specific ways depending on the shape of the mass in front of it."
1445.525,1450.129," Now, there's lots and lots of stuff out in the background parts of the universe."
1450.969,1460.697,So the chances that I'm going to get lucky if I have a cluster of galaxies that something's going to get distorted in the background is pretty high.
1461.257,1466.341,"And with the ballet cluster, we have two galaxy clusters in the process of merging together."
1466.441,1472.186,So we have lots and lots of mass working to distort the light coming from background objects.
1473.76,1483.552, There are people who can run these amazing computer models that look at the way the light is distorted and work backwards to figure out what mass is doing the distorting.
1484.947,1494.01," When they do this, they are able to directly map where the mass that we can't see must be located on top of the mass that we do see."
1495.411,1499.372,It's a way of sort of mapping out a room with your eyes closed.
1499.572,1502.653,"You can do it, it's just not as easy as doing it with your eyes open."
1504.594,1507.815,"And they're getting results that say, here is the missing mass."
1508.455,1512.817,"We know where it is, we still can't see the stuff, but we know exactly where it's located."
1513.157,1536.931," Well, if I recall, and I reported this a bit in Universe Today, that these two galaxy clusters collided, and when galaxies kind of collide, they often will pass right through each other, because the actual chance of stars and planets and stuff colliding with each other is very low, and so these galaxies kind of pass through each other like ghosts, but the gas in the two galaxies actually"
1537.751,1540.513, did kind of have friction and run into each other.
1540.934,1554.224,"And so what you got was you got the galaxies pass, and once again I'm making hand symbols in front of me that no one can see, but the galaxies pass through each other, the stars and planets flew right past each other, but the gas had enough friction that it slowed down."
1554.524,1561.83,And what happened was then you got a change in the distribution of the mass between the galaxies and this cloud of gas.
1562.29,1568.735," And they were then able to calculate, once again, as well, the distribution of the dark matter."
1568.755,1571.698,And they found that the dark matter didn't collide as well.
1571.738,1573.239,And so the dark matter was frictionless.
1573.72,1575.421,The stars and planets were frictionless.
1575.801,1577.703,But the gas did have friction.
1577.743,1579.304,It collided and kind of slowed down.
1579.724,1587.471,"And so the dark matter just passed right through each other and passed right past all of the stars and planets as well, which was brand new."
1588.066,1589.267, There was two different ways.
1589.427,1595.21,"I tend to be a visual thinker, so I was focusing in on the way the light got bent with the gravitational lensing."
1595.25,1596.391,But you're entirely right.
1596.431,1606.176,There's also the kinematical arguments of we look at this and we see all the heated up gas that is piled up in the center of these two collisions.
1606.656,1610.659,"That's mapped out in x-ray light where we can see this high, high temperature gas."
1611.559,1617.164," And then we look at the stars and the galaxies as individuals, and they did pass right through each other."
1617.785,1620.347,And the dark matter did the same thing according to the maps.
1620.748,1625.592,"And so we're able to say, aha, yes, this is not interacting stuff."
1626.413,1635.842,And it's doing everything that a non-baryonic group of whatevers should be doing.
1636.067,1642.989," Yeah, so the evidence is still out, and we will continue to report on it when new stuff comes out."
1643.049,1645.99,I think it's what a lot of people are looking for.
1646.09,1654.452,"So I think over the next couple of years and decades, we're going to have some really interesting new research and new results."
1654.492,1658.813,"So once again, thank you, Pamela, for helping us get to the bottom of this."
1658.873,1660.593,Or I guess we didn't even get to the bottom of it.
1663.374,1664.215, Scratch the surface.
1664.235,1669.458,"At least gave people an understanding of the controversy so that they can, you know, can talk intelligently about it."
1670.479,1676.663,"Once again, if you do have any questions or comments for us, please send us an email at info at astronomycast.com."
1677.083,1682.387,"So for me and for Dr. Pamela Gay, we'd like to thank you for taking the time to listen to us, and we'll see you next week."
1683.708,1687.57,"This has been Astronomy Cast, a weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos."
