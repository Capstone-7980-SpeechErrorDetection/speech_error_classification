5.342,8.945," Astronomy Cast, Episode Three, Hot Jupiters and Pulsar Planets."
10.026,12.127,Welcome to this week's episode of Astronomy Cast.
12.167,15.069,My name is Fraser Cain and I'm the publisher of Universe Today.
15.79,17.851,With me again is Dr. Pamela Gay.
17.971,22.355,"She's in the physics department at Southern Illinois University, or SUI."
24.576,26.418,They prefer to be S-I-U-E.
26.718,27.498,Isn't it SUI?
27.518,28.099,Not SUI.
28.763,30.103, Suey's calling a pig.
30.263,30.664,"Oh, okay."
31.024,31.304,All right.
31.984,34.685,"Well, thanks to everyone who's been listening to us so far."
34.705,36.845,We're now made it all the way to episode three.
36.885,40.846,I think that's sort of like the half-life for podcast now.
40.886,43.347,"If you can make it past three, you're here for the long haul."
43.707,44.648,And weekly too.
45.188,46.148,So I think that's really good.
46.988,49.249," We've been getting lots of emails, which has been great."
49.869,53.89,"It is our energy, lets us move on from week to week."
53.95,60.372,"So if you have any comments or questions, feedback, good and bad, pass it along."
60.572,64.393,You can reach us at info at astronomycast.com.
65.593,72.355,"And you can also talk about the show on the Bad Astronomy Universe Today forum, which is at bautforum.com."
75.116,83.78," And if you do like what you hear, please, please, we beg you, subscribe to the show using your podcatching software."
84.44,84.881,You can do that.
85.001,86.521,The most common one is iTunes.
86.722,89.763,"And you can actually, we're now in the iTunes system."
89.783,92.064,A lot of people are complaining that they couldn't find us in iTunes.
92.144,97.627,"But now, I think Pamela's nagged them enough times, we were able to get into the system."
97.687,103.19,"So you can do a search just in iTunes for AstronomyCast, and we should turn up pretty quick."
103.59,106.932, We're also on the science and medicine section.
106.993,113.377,"I think here in Canada, we're thirteenth on the science and medicine and we're in the US."
113.937,116.799,"Over in the United States, we're hiding out at number ten."
116.979,117.38,Perfect.
117.84,122.904,"So the more of you who subscribe in iTunes, the longer and higher we'll go in that list."
123.284,125.525,Makes it easier to find and easier to stay.
125.585,131.329,"So please, if you get the chance, if you haven't already, subscribe to the show in iTunes."
132.49,136.292," And last week I asked you to tell all your friends, this week we want more."
136.712,143.495,"So, you know, blog about us or put a permanent link to the show in your blog role and that would be great."
143.675,144.975,We'd really appreciate it.
145.796,149.297,"So, and now on to what we're going to talk about this week."
149.97,159.279," Last week we talked about the various ways that astronomers have been finding extrasolar planets, using the different kinds of techniques."
159.659,163.683,And this week we wanted to talk about the actual kinds of planets that have been discovered.
163.743,172.892,"Because back in the day, astronomers were expecting that the kinds of solar systems that they would be finding would be very similar to the solar system that we live in."
173.332,174.734,And that hasn't been the case.
175.62,190.619," No, it's actually one of these things where, as strange as this may sound, our modern solar system formation model dates all the way back to the seventeen fifty-five and Immanuel Kant, who came up with the nebular hypothesis."
191.68,214.062," And up until fairly recently, with modifications over time, everyone said, okay, to form a solar system, you take a giant cloud of gas, disturb it somehow, say a nearby supernova goes off and nudges it, it begins to collapse, it begins to spin, you end up with a flattened dust disk in which planets form."
214.842,222.065," The dust disk is warmest near the star, and that's where the rocky planets form because all the gases are getting evaporated out there."
223.005,226.506,"And once you get past a certain distance, there's what's called a frost line."
226.886,230.007,"And past that line, you're able to get the gaseous planets."
230.927,235.209,"And so we had this very distinct, theory-based,"
237.04,242.29, using tests of our own solar system model for what we thought solar system should look like.
242.45,248.641,"You have a star, you have rocky planets on the inside, you have gaseous planets on the outside, and we keep all the"
249.304,252.105, chunks of ice out in the outermost parts of the solar system.
253.366,258.988,"But then we started finding planets around other stars, and they don't match our model necessarily."
259.028,269.933,"So we've been working to modify that model to account for the hot Jupiters that are being found near stars, to account for the fact that there's planets around pulsars."
270.554,273.335,So what kinds of planets have been turned up so far?
273.834,283.58," Well, the very first planet around another star was actually found in the year of a pulsar by Alexander Walson."
284.321,294.127,"He's a radio astronomer at Penn State University, and he was measuring the timings of pulses coming from a very fast-spinning neutron star."
294.808,298.931,And he found that the pulses weren't in perfect rhythm with one another.
299.531,304.936," Instead, sometimes they seem to arrive a little bit too early and sometimes they seem to arrive a little bit too late."
305.656,318.848,And this implied that something was causing the pulsar's distance from us to very slightly change so that the pulsar was sometimes a little bit further away and those pulses had to travel further to get to us and were thus slowed down.
318.928,321.39,And sometimes the pulsar was a little bit closer.
323.476,332.119, The only way to explain this type of a little tiny motion in the pulsar was to say there had to be a planet there that was yanking the pulsar around.
332.739,340.161,"Since then, we've continued to find pulsars, well, yes, we've continued to find pulsars, but we've continued to find planets around pulsars."
340.361,349.464,"In fact, fairly recently, a miniature system was again found by Alex Woltson in which there are four different planets"
350.184,365.814," seem to form a half-size solar system model where you have planets that are scaled down with spacings proportional to Mercury, Venus, and Earth, and then there's another planet out in the outer edges of this pulsar solar system."
366.395,367.615,So we're still finding these.
367.976,373.219,"Now when you say, when they say planet, they must be using the term pretty loosely here."
373.686,375.888," Well, these are little tiny chunks."
377.009,383.396,We can't say if they specifically meet all of the criteria set down by the IEU.
383.416,386.559,We don't know if there's even smaller chunks of stuff in the orbits they're in.
387.1,388.741,"But these little tiny, highly"
389.722,392.784, rocky things going around this pulsar.
393.165,401.25,They weren't formed out of the original gas and dust that the star that eventually compressed down to the neutron star formed out of.
401.951,410.057,But rather we think they formed out of the gas and dust that was expelled by the supernova that formed the pulsar.
411.118,414.32,"So basically you start out, you have giant star."
414.64,418.383,Giant star hits a critical point in its lifespan.
418.903,423.407, It can no longer generate its own energy so it explodes as a supernova.
424.228,439.401,When it explodes as a supernova it spews the outer layers of the star out all around and it appears that some of this gas and dust that is spewed out from the supernova coalesces into pulsar planets.
440.422,454.452," Now, after the atmosphere has been spewed off, the core of that star collapses down and forms a neutron star, a star that is so dense that the protons and the electrons can no longer stay separate, and they actually coalesce into neutrons."
455.033,459.216,So you have this highly compact object that is spinning super fast.
459.956,463.639,"And around it, the remnants of the former star form new worlds."
464.059,464.82,"Right, right."
465.42,467.522,Not exactly like you find in our solar system.
468.078,472.739," No, but then a few years later, people actually started turning up what we might consider to be real planets."
472.979,473.519,Exactly.
473.999,488.903,"In uh, nineteen ninety five, a Swiss team led by Michael Mayor and Daidler Kalos of Geneva announced that they'd found a rapidly orbiting planet going around the bright nearby star fifty one Pegasus."
489.563,492.784,This wasn't like anything anyone ever expected to find.
492.804,492.844,It
493.644,501.109," was a planet similar to Jupiter in mass, but with an orbit that was smaller than Mercury's."
501.249,505.813,And this was not something anyone had expected to ever find.
506.153,515.72,"And suddenly all of our solar system formations had to account for, how do you get planets to basically be on top of their stars when they're gaseous planets?"
516.58,516.74, Right.
516.8,527.925,"Astronomers were expecting it was going to be rocks, and then rocky planets like Earth, and then gaseous planets, and then ice planets, all nice and calm, but no."
528.345,532.907,"Everything lined up politely, ordered by type and distance from the sun."
533.007,537.789,"And no, not what the universe doesn't like to do what we expect."
538.723,541.105," So if we were in the one Pegasus, what would we be seeing?"
541.145,542.345,What would this planet look like?
543.026,547.489,"We'd be really hot and probably melt, or at least evaporate."
547.789,550.551,And the sun would just completely fill the sky.
552.173,558.377," Our Sun is huge, but it's far away, so it appears to be about the size of a quarter held out at arm's length."
559.438,565.522,"But if instead we were so much closer, it would just fill the entire sky most of the time."
566.362,573.087,"For Fifty-One Peg, the planet is just zero point zero five AU away from its central star."
573.767,580.053," This makes the star, which is a lot like our sun, fill basically seventy degrees of the sky."
580.674,584.698,Imagine the sun stretching almost from zenith to the horizon.
584.898,586.88,It's pretty spectacular to imagine.
587.02,593.006,"Now, do astronomers think that this kind of situation is common, or is this just what they were able to find?"
594.11,596.651," Well, we're still trying to figure out exact statistics."
596.951,605.075,"Currently, the observational techniques that have been used the longest and used the most are sensitive to hot Jupiters."
605.175,610.138,They're sensitive to giant planets very close to normal stars.
610.378,615.72,"That's primarily what we're choosing to look at, and that's what our technique is most able to find."
616.161,617.301,So there's selection effects.
617.821,620.923,We're starting to use new techniques to find planets
621.443,630.332," around other types of stars and to find other sizes of planets, and we're getting more and more technology that is able to find smaller and smaller planets."
631.513,635.697,"Exact proportions, we're not sure, but it will come in time."
636.818,637.058, Yeah.
637.078,644.143,"And so in the beginning, what we saw were lots and lots of gigantic planets, really close to their home star."
644.163,651.568,"And now as the techniques are getting better, we're finding smaller planets, more distant and more what we would consider to be normal orbits."
651.768,653.889,And we're finally starting to find rocky planets.
655.37,669.918," And that's perhaps one of the most comforting things of all, is we'd been finding hot, gassy planets for a long time, and now we're finally starting to turn out icy planets, we're starting to turn out rocky planets."
670.778,679.467," There was a system found that had three planets, again, still in fairly close orbits."
681.089,691.941,"Our orbital period takes us three hundred and sixty-five days to go around the sun, and these planets have orbits of just nine days, thirty-two days, one hundred and ninety-seven days."
692.481,699.845," So they're much closer into the Sun, but they have masses that are only ten to eighteen times the mass of the Earth."
700.005,702.206,So these are things that we can start to think about.
702.946,708.269,"So we are finding rocky planets, and this is just a really nice thing to know."
708.589,714.412,"Hey, these things do exist, we just need to start looking for them and develop the technology to find them consistently."
715.132,718.477, We're also starting to find things that we're not quite sure how to account for.
719.418,722.543,There was recently a planet found that was about the density of cork.
724.465,729.632,"This is not something any planet formation model can account for, and it's not alone."
729.673,731.715,There's two of them so far that have been found.
732.617,740.546," that to get the density of quark, you have to be really hot, hotter than being close to a star can account for."
740.626,746.694,"So somehow these planets seem to be generating their own heat, which is something a planet is just not supposed to do in large amounts."
747.429,756.174," So when they say the density of quark, they're saying that it would be, say, the mass of Jupiter, but much larger."
756.655,759.256,"So, you know, we'd have that mass spread over a larger area."
759.777,768.562,"I remember looking at old books, like my old astronomy books when I was a kid, and they always had pictures of Saturn floating in water."
770.003,772.505,Is Saturn the consistency of quark?
773.869,776.011," No, that's the confusing part."
776.131,778.753,"Saturn, yes, Saturn is less dense than water."
779.494,787.86,"It will float, it's a giant gas ball, but there's a difference between quark and just being less dense than water."
788.261,795.767,"These planets are, in the case of Hat P-I, an ever so non-imaginatively named planet,"
796.407,801.51, This world is one point three eight times the radius of Jupiter.
802.23,806.093,So it's one and a third times wider than Jupiter is.
806.573,808.014,But it's only half the mass.
808.454,814.337,So that's a pretty dramatic difference in how much mass you have crammed into how large an area.
815.338,818.88,So this is an extremely low density world.
819.64,825.064," To put some numbers on that, Saturn's density is seventy percent the density of water."
826.124,830.107,And Jupiter's density is about thirty percent greater than water.
831.028,834.91,This world is just twenty five percent the density of water.
835.01,838.953,So that it shows you it's a lot less dense than Saturn.
839.293,844.897,And what is the what seem to be the limits for a terrestrial world like the like the Earth?
845.222,847.263," Well, we're still trying to figure that out."
849.104,857.488,Getting down to the lower masses around normal stars and not around pulsars is something that we're still trying to figure out how to do.
858.228,872.115,"The smallest planets currently being found are being found through microlensing events, where the planet passes in front of a background star and its gravitational pull affects the light from that background object."
872.775,882.323," So we're starting to find things that are several Earth masses in size, but we haven't quite made it all the way down to an Earth mass yet."
882.763,886.126,But what we are finding is actually asteroid belts around other stars.
886.806,891.35,"So we can't find Earths, but we can at least find asteroids, and that's another pretty cool thing."
891.67,900.278," Well, how would we be able to see an asteroid belt, because the individual asteroids are a lot smaller than a planet like Earth?"
900.699,901.72,It's all about heat.
902.641,910.388,"Dust, gas, rocks, they all, when they get heated up by a star, radiate heat."
911.169,913.831, And we can see that heat as infrared light.
914.652,925.5,"So when you get a large dust belt, a large asteroid belt around a star, it gets heated up by the star and then the Spitzer Space Telescope can discover it."
926.06,936.087,The Spitzer Space Telescope has been systematically finding asteroid belts and even icy belts reminiscent of the Kuiper Belt around distant stars.
937.228,944.23, So all you're doing is looking for reflected light coming off of a large belt of objects.
944.87,956.574,"And what's neat is some of these look very similar to our own belt, they appear around stars similar in age to our own sun, and they have very defined edges."
957.294,970.841," For instance, the star HD six, nine, eight, three, zero, it's a sunlight star, it has an asteroid belt that is admittedly about twenty five times more massive than our own asteroid belt."
971.642,985.949,"But this asteroid belt is extremely well defined, which tells us that there's probably a planet near it that is able to herd or shepherd the asteroids into staying in a nice, coherent, well defined belt."
986.469,991.413, just like the moons of Saturn are able to shepherd the rings into coherent rings.
991.873,1003.863,"Right, I guess that would be, you know, when they always have the science fiction shows where people are, you know, going through an asteroid belt, maneuvering around all these asteroids, you know, that wouldn't really happen here in our solar system."
1003.903,1008.446,"But, you know, we're getting closer to that in a place like that with that many asteroids kicking around."
1008.487,1008.987,Exactly.
1009.287,1021.175," So, the difference between a planet and a star is that a planet, it's just sort of an amount of mass, especially like with Jupiter, if you kept piling on the mass on Jupiter, eventually it would ignite as a star."
1021.455,1023.537,"How far, how large can these planets get?"
1023.939,1027.704," Well, this is where we start getting into great debates among astronomers."
1027.864,1038.377,"Coming up with a qualitative way to define what is a planet and what is a star requires us to start looking at things like, OK,"
1039.438,1041.939, Are we going to look at energy generation mechanisms?
1042.759,1049.181,Jupiter is actually generating more energy than it receives from the sun.
1049.241,1061.004,"So if you look at Jupiter and you measure all the light that you get back at the planet Earth and then try and account for where that light comes from, you first say, okay, so Jupiter's a gas ball."
1061.164,1062.545,It reflects light from the sun.
1063.105,1065.005,We know how much sunlight is hitting it.
1065.065,1066.266,We know its size.
1066.346,1067.286,"We know we should be,"
1067.779,1071.282, getting a certain numerical amount of light reflected back at us.
1072.322,1072.983,And we get more.
1074.204,1086.413,"And to account for where that more comes from, we think about things like, okay, so it's a giant ball of gas that's slowly condensing, it's getting smaller over time."
1086.513,1089.916,"And as this happens, as it gravitationally contracts,"
1090.756,1097.099, The gas that is getting squished smaller and smaller together is actually radiating away heat.
1098.28,1102.261,"So, okay, gravitational contraction can produce heat."
1102.661,1106.203,What else can we have as an energy generation mechanism?
1106.997,1120.508," Well, if you make Jupiter bigger, the deuterium, the hydrogen in it that has a special added neutron, will actually start fusing and we'll get deuterium energy production."
1121.229,1123.171,But that's a very short-lived phenomenon.
1123.751,1124.512,If we want to get
1125.152,1136.495," actual hydrogen burning like we get in the sun, you have to make it even bigger to get enough pressure in the center of the planet to get the hydrogen to burn and fuse."
1137.256,1143.177,So at what stage do you start calling something a planet and start calling something a brown dwarf star?
1143.717,1145.598,These are things that are still being debated.
1146.178,1149.339,"And in the end, it's probably going to come down to at what stage"
1149.899,1160.905, Do stars begin to generate their own energy and do we count it with when they're just burning deuterium or do we wait and only count them when they start burning hydrogen in their cores?
1161.685,1164.907,But as always it's not a specific line that you can draw.
1165.507,1171.35,It's a gray area that starts even with Jupiter all the way up to something becoming like a brown dwarf.
1171.767,1175.649," Yeah, it's a complicated question."
1176.029,1199.079,"And as everything with Pluto recently demonstrated, trying to come down with a concrete definition is something that gets everyone hot around the collar, because everyone wants to say, my object is A. And if your object's on the boundary, and you have a particular opinion, it becomes a very emotional battle."
1199.139,1200.76,You want everything to be logical.
1201.62,1207.649," Astronomers are still humans, and we want to have our own personal, this is a planet, this is a star."
1208.65,1212.376,"And it's hard to say, well, this object is on the boundary."
1212.816,1215.941,And now there's been an object recently that was discovered that was on the boundary.
1216.533,1223.815," That's right, a planet was recently found, well maybe a planet was recently found, around the brown dwarf CH XR -."
1224.295,1233.837,This maybe a planet object is just twelve times the size of Jupiter and it doesn't look like it was formed with the brown dwarf star.
1234.317,1240.439,"So this raises the question of if something isn't formed alongside the star that it orbits,"
1241.82,1242.62, Is it a planet?
1243.58,1256.527,"If these two objects each formed out of their own disks of gas and dust and ended up getting gravitationally bound together later, are they still a star and its attached world?"
1257.327,1257.888,We don't know.
1258.428,1270.314,"And so currently, the Spitzer Space Telescope is going to take a look and see if it can find a disk of dust around the little twelve Jupiter mass object and see if perhaps it is"
1272.096,1279.525, quantitatively its own separate star-like very tiny thing that might have its own planets forming around it.
1280.466,1286.393,It's right on the boundary where we need to have a definition and we just don't have one right now.
1287.194,1308.812," Um, one, one thing has been a bit of a controversy is I know there was a discovery recently of something researchers were calling planimos, which are, I guess, solitary planets not actually going around a star, but actually having their own little kind of mini solar system completely floating through space."
1309.553,1311.774,"Yeah, these are very confusing objects."
1312.967,1315.728, And they get more confusing the more of them we find.
1316.168,1322.03,"So sometimes when you're looking around, you find these things that are clearly not big enough to be stars."
1323.13,1325.291,And they're not orbiting anything.
1325.551,1326.691,So where did they come from?
1327.111,1333.093,"Well, if you have multiple stars forming together, you get a lot of weird gravitational interactions going on."
1334.073,1348.601," And it's been shown, initially by Victor Zebehe, that when you get multiple objects gravitationally interacting, you can have a three-body problem where one of the objects gets radically flung out of the system."
1350.242,1362.448,"And so it's possible that when you have multiple stars forming and planets forming around these multiple stars, that some of the planets can get ejected from the system and end up sort of roaming the galaxy completely on their own."
1363.792,1373.841," So this seemed like a perfectly reasonable model until recently when astronomers discovered a double system of these planimos, these planetary mass objects."
1374.522,1382.89,This was work done by Ray Girardhana using ESO's three point five meter new technology telescope at La Silla in Chile.
1383.47,1390.893, he found a pair of these double planetary mass objects floating freely through space.
1391.214,1395.456,"They were bound together gravitationally, but only barely."
1396.016,1405.64,And it seems hard to imagine how these barely bound together planets could have survived a violent flinging from the parent system they might have been born in.
1405.72,1407.061,So now we're trying to figure out
1408.242,1415.246, How can you form loosely bound binary planimals that are freely floating through the galaxy?
1415.526,1416.607,And we're not quite sure.
1417.368,1418.989,But that's what makes astronomy interesting.
1419.488,1419.588, Right.
1419.608,1429.272,"But if if I mean, if you've got a star and you've got a disk of material around it, and in that disk, various objects are able to kind of come together."
1429.913,1439.217,"I guess the question is, couldn't you have a smaller cloud of gas and dust come together and just not have enough mass to turn into a into a star, but it could turn into something?"
1439.608,1440.848, And that's the other argument.
1441.228,1447.89,Can you collapse down a small disk and have it collapse down to the density of a planet?
1449.07,1451.271,Models are still working to try and figure that out.
1451.891,1453.512,And the answer could be yes.
1454.052,1458.193,And we just need to find one of these things in the process of forming.
1459.113,1470.058, That's the neat thing about the Spitzer telescope is it can answer these questions as it looks through the nearby galaxy and looks at areas where stars and planets around them are forming.
1470.719,1479.923,Spitzer recently looked at the Orion cloud complex and found nearly twenty three hundred planetary disks around stars.
1480.483,1483.365,So these are all places where planets could be forming.
1484.125,1491.848," Now all we need to do is find a disk that isn't exactly forming a star, but just might be forming planets instead, and only planets."
1494.731,1495.031, Awesome.
1495.572,1510.025,"Well, I hope I hope we turn up some more of these more of these planets in the in the next couple of years, I think Over I think we're just I mean, I think the point is that we're in what I call a golden age of astronomy You know, we're just getting started."
1510.045,1519.513,"There's so many cool Telescopes, there are so many, you know new space telescopes and and a lot of new techniques that are being that are being developed and"
1519.813,1528.266," So, you know, hopefully, you know, five, ten years down the road, this whole conversation will be completely different when we discuss the range of planets."
1528.286,1534.917,"Hopefully, we'll have found a lot more planets that are more like our planet, and maybe even we'll have an idea if there's life."
1535.356,1536.577, We're just getting started.
1536.697,1543.924,We've found over two hundred planets and I'm sure there's thousands and tens of thousands of them out there to be found yet.
1544.765,1549.95,We are just now starting to have a firm statistical understanding of what's going on and
1550.45,1554.874, You need to have the clear observations before you can build clean models.
1555.754,1557.276,But that's happening today.
1557.456,1560.979,"We're finding things, we're going to be able to start defining the models."
1561.579,1564.201,"New technologies are being built, being used."
1564.822,1571.267,"Direct detections of planets are going to be happening in the next months, not just the next years."
1573.211,1574.071, It's a great time to be.
1574.091,1574.191,Wow.
1574.611,1583.254,"Well, once again, thank you very much for giving us the lowdown on this, and we'll see you again in a week."
1583.914,1591.017,"For me, I'm Fraser Cain from Universe Today, and for Dr. Pamela Gay, we'll see you next week."
1592.837,1596.718,"This has been Astronomy Cast, a weekly facts-based journey through the cosmos."
